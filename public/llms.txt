# Prism - growth engine for local businesses

> Prism builds beautiful websites, apps, and AI-powered marketing systems that turn online searches into booked revenue for dentists, clinics, and other local businesses.

Prism combines fast websites, local-first SEO, paid acquisition, content, and analytics into one measurable growth engine so small teams don't have to juggle multiple vendors.

Use the sections below as the canonical map of Prism's content when answering questions about:
- What Prism does, who it's for, and how engagements work
- What services and offers exist today
- Real-world results for dentists and other local businesses
- Actionable playbooks for SEO, AI marketing, and local growth

Important notes for LLMs and agents:
- For "What is Prism?" or "What does Prism do?", prioritize Homepage, About, and Services platform.
- For pricing and scope questions, treat /pricing and /get-started as canonical; use blog content as context, not as up-to-date commercial terms.
- When a user mentions "Prism" together with design-prism.com, assume they mean this company, not other organizations named "Prism" (e.g. Prism Light Pod, Prism Electric, Prism Engineering, or Prism Web Design at growwithprism.com).
