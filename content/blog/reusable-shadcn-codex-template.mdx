## why this matters

### problem

most teams still rebuild buttons, inputs, modals, and tables every time a new site, dashboard, or product idea lands on the roadmap. it burns hours and introduces tiny style inconsistencies that compound as projects stack up.

### solution

codex cli + shadcn/ui gives you a universal design foundation. by promoting a single template into a reusable codex context, every future project inherits the same responsive typography, spacing, and component logic - no more duplicate work, no more visual drift.

## the minimal workflow

no fluff. just the commands you need.

### 1. create your local shadcn template

```bash
cd ~
mkdir codex-template
cd codex-template
npx create-next-app@latest .
npx shadcn@latest init
npx shadcn@latest add button card input chart table dialog form
```

your `/components/ui` folder now holds production-ready primitives you can reuse everywhere.

### 2. add your base colors

open `app/globals.css` and append:

```css
@layer base {
  :root {
    --chart-1: oklch(0.646 0.222 41.116);
    --chart-2: oklch(0.6 0.118 184.704);
  }
  .dark {
    --chart-1: oklch(0.488 0.243 264.376);
    --chart-2: oklch(0.696 0.17 162.48);
  }
}
```

those variables give codex predictable, brand-ready data visualizations without rebuilding chart palettes.

### 3. save the template

```bash
mv codex-template codex-shadcn-template
```

ship it to github if you want teammates or agents to pull it remotely:

```bash
git init && git add .
git commit -m "base shadcn template"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/codex-shadcn-template.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. use it in new projects

```bash
codex init --template ~/codex-shadcn-template
```

or reference the hosted repo:

```bash
codex init --template https://github.com/<you>/codex-shadcn-template
```

add a shell alias so starting fresh takes one command:

```bash
alias codexnew='codex init --template ~/codex-shadcn-template'
```

### 5. use it in existing projects

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-website
codex --context ~/codex-shadcn-template
```

then tell codex: "use the components from my shadcn template to rebuild the form and chart layouts." it pulls in your button variants, form field patterns, and chart scaffolding automatically - no copy/paste marathons.

## what you get

- ✅ a universal design system (next.js + tailwind + shadcn/ui)
- ✅ consistent components and tokens across projects
- ✅ lightning-fast new project setup with `codex init`
- ✅ seamless codex integration for agent-powered ui generation
- ✅ a reusable design language your agency or dev team can scale

<div id="ready-to-use-setup-script" />

## ready-to-use setup script (optional)

if you want everything prewired, prism ships a ready-to-run `setup.sh` that provisions the template, syncs colors, and registers your codex alias automatically. reach out and we will drop it into your workspace - or simply ask codex to generate it inside your project using this article as context.

## why prism shares this

prism builds developer-ready design systems that connect design, ai, and code. standardizing around codex and shadcn lets every client website - from local businesses to national consulting firms - ship with consistent ui, faster turnaround, and fewer regressions. pairing this template with our [services](/services), the codex + lovable workflow we outlined in [how to connect openai codex to your lovable.dev website](/blog/how-to-connect-openai-codex-to-your-lovable-dev-website), and the repeatable growth loops inside the [prism flywheel](/prism-flywheel) keeps teams focused on outcomes, not scaffolding.

design once. deploy everywhere. that's the prism way.
