<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
midjourney recently released a video feature that lets you bring your prompts to life. we decided to test it on prism's homepage, replacing our static hero image with short, looping motion. the result is a subtle animation that loads quickly and gives visitors an instant sense of energy.
</p>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">why video?</h2>

<p className="mb-6">
we've always used gradients and clean typography to keep the site lightweight. but a bit of movement can go a long way in drawing the eye. midjourney's new tool made it easy to generate a short clip that matched our branding without spending hours in a traditional editor.
</p>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">our quick workflow</h2>

<ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
  <li>we wrote a simple prompt describing the vibe we wanted—"colorful geometric shapes swirling in a smooth loop".</li>
  <li>midjourney rendered a 4-second video in seconds. we trimmed it to a 2-second loop.</li>
  <li>the clip was converted to <code>.webm</code> for maximum compression.</li>
  <li>we dropped it into our next.js page using a lightweight <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag with <code>autoplay</code>, <code>loop</code>, and <code>muted</code>.</li>
  <li>to keep performance high, the video only loads once the hero section scrolls into view.</li>
</ol>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">try it yourself</h2>

<p className="mb-6">
if you want to experiment with midjourney video on your own site, start small. generate a short loop that complements your design, compress it to <code>.webm</code>, and lazy load it so it doesn't block the page. it's a surprisingly simple upgrade that can make your site feel more alive.
</p>

<p className="mb-6">
that’s all there is to it. minimal effort, maximum effect—just how we like it.
