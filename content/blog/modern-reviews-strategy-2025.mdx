## Why Reviews Still Matter

In today’s world, your reviews are more than social proof — they’re a signal of trust, quality, and reputation across every search engine and AI system.

Whether someone finds you on Google, Apple Maps, or ChatGPT, your reputation online determines how often you’re discovered, how credible you look, and how many people choose you.

## The Big Picture

There are hundreds of review platforms — but not all of them matter. Here’s the simple mental model:

- **Google = visibility.** Drives Maps rankings, SEO, and conversions.
- **Apple = reach.** Feeds Apple Maps, Siri, and iPhone searches. Apple now operates its own review ecosystem, influencing Siri and Maps discovery.
- **Yelp = reputation.** Feeds Apple Maps and influences consumer trust.
- **Vertical platforms = authority.** Category-specific sites that build niche credibility.
- **AEO (AI engine optimization) = future-proofing.** ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other AI tools pull from structured, trusted data — including your reviews.

## The Core Platforms to Focus On

### 1. Google Business Profile

Your #1 priority.

- Appears in Google Search, Maps, and AI summaries  
- Drives the majority of new leads for local businesses  
- Signals quality, recency, and engagement

**Action steps**

- Ask every customer for a Google review after their visit (via email or text)  
- Never pay or incentivize reviews  
- Respond to every review within 48 hours

### 2. Apple Business Connect

Apple Maps and Siri run on this system — and it’s becoming its own review network.

- iPhones account for over 50% of mobile searches  
- Apple now shows a mix of native user ratings, partner reviews (Yelp, Tripadvisor, Foursquare), and expert sources like MICHELIN Guide and The Infatuation  
- Your Apple Business Connect profile directly controls what Siri and Apple Maps display about your business

**Action steps**

- Claim and verify your Apple Business Connect profile  
- Add accurate categories, high-quality photos, hours, and booking links  
- Use “Showcases” to highlight offers or updates  
- Encourage happy iPhone users to rate your business directly in Apple Maps (thumbs-up and photo uploads count)  
- Monitor your connected review sources — Yelp, Tripadvisor, and others still feed Apple’s data

**Why it matters**

Apple Maps is shifting from a “Yelp-powered directory” to a first-party discovery platform. Businesses with a strong, verified Apple presence (and recent positive ratings) are appearing more frequently in Siri voice results and Apple Maps suggestions — even when Google results differ.

### 3. Yelp

Still an important signal — but tread carefully.

- Yelp powers reviews for Apple Maps in many regions  
- Its content still ranks high for service-based businesses  
- Yelp filters aggressively — avoid asking customers directly

**Action steps**

- Do not request Yelp reviews (they’ll be hidden or flagged)  
- Keep your profile fresh with photos, hours, and accurate info  
- Respond to reviews professionally — even negative ones

### 4. Industry-Specific Platforms

Choose 1–3 depending on your field.

- **Dentistry / healthcare:** Healthgrades, Zocdoc, WebMD, RateMDs  
- **Hospitality / tourism:** Tripadvisor, OpenTable, MICHELIN  
- **Professional / B2B:** Trustpilot, G2, Capterra

These sites often show up on the first page of Google for your category. Being listed here increases your authority in both search and AI systems.

## How Google and OpenAI Use Reviews

**Google**

- Prioritizes reviews in Google Business Profiles  
- Evaluates recency, quantity, and response rate  
- Considers overall brand “prominence” across the web

**OpenAI / ChatGPT**

- Aggregates data from trusted review platforms  
- Uses structured data (like schema markup) from your website  
- Surfaces businesses with consistent, verified, high-quality reviews

**Apple / Siri**

- Hosts its own native review system (ratings + photos)  
- Still aggregates from trusted sources like Yelp and Tripadvisor  
- Siri pulls directly from Apple Maps data — meaning your Apple profile and ratings directly influence voice search visibility

**What to do now (for Prism clients)**

- Keep Yelp/Tripadvisor profiles strong — Apple still pulls from them  
- Encourage iPhone users to rate your business in Apple Maps  
- Regularly update your Apple Business Connect dashboard  
- Use Apple’s “Showcases” and high-quality photos to drive clicks  
- Track Siri/Apple Maps performance separately from Google

## Best Practices

- ✅ Ask for reviews consistently — not in bursts  
- ✅ Reply to every review (shows engagement)  
- ✅ Use real customer stories — not generic text  
- ✅ Add testimonials and review schema to your website  
- ✅ Keep name, address, and phone identical across all platforms

## What Good Looks Like

- Average rating: **4.7–4.9 stars**  
- New reviews: **weekly or biweekly**  
- Responses: **within 48 hours**  
- Consistency: **same business info across Google, Apple, Yelp, and your site**  
- Real proof: **customer photos, service examples, and case studies**

## The Simple Rule

80% effort on Google, 10% on Apple, 10% on your top industry platforms. Yelp and others matter — but focus where visibility actually converts.
