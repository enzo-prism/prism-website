## Why Reviews Still Matter

In today’s world, your reviews are more than social proof — they’re a signal of trust, quality, and reputation across every search engine and AI system.

Whether someone finds you on Google, Apple Maps, or ChatGPT, your reputation online determines how often you’re discovered, how credible you look, and how many people choose you.

## The Big Picture

There are hundreds of review platforms — but not all of them matter. Here’s the simple mental model:

- **Google = visibility.** Drives Maps rankings, SEO, and conversions.
- **Apple = reach.** Feeds Apple Maps, Siri, and iPhone searches.
- **Yelp = reputation.** Feeds Apple Maps and influences consumer trust.
- **Vertical platforms = authority.** Category-specific sites that build niche credibility.
- **AEO (AI engine optimization) = future-proofing.** ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other AI tools pull from structured, trusted data — including your reviews.

## The Core Platforms to Focus On

### 1. Google Business Profile

Your #1 priority.

- Appears in Google Search, Maps, and AI summaries  
- Drives the majority of new leads for local businesses  
- Signals quality, recency, and engagement

**Action steps**

- Ask every customer for a Google review after their visit (via email or text)  
- Never pay or incentivize reviews  
- Respond to every review within 48 hours

### 2. Apple Business Connect

Apple Maps and Siri run on this system.

- iPhones account for over 50% of mobile searches  
- Apple Maps reviews now integrate with third-party partners (Yelp, Tripadvisor, etc.)  
- Helps you show up when users say “Hey Siri, find a [your service] near me”

**Action steps**

- Claim your Apple Business Connect profile  
- Add categories, images, hours, and booking links  
- Post “Showcases” (Apple’s version of updates or promos)

### 3. Yelp

Still an important signal — but tread carefully.

- Yelp powers reviews for Apple Maps in many regions  
- Its content still ranks high for service-based businesses  
- Yelp filters aggressively — avoid asking customers directly

**Action steps**

- Do not request Yelp reviews (they’ll be hidden or flagged)  
- Keep your profile fresh with photos, hours, and accurate info  
- Respond to reviews professionally — even negative ones

### 4. Industry-Specific Platforms

Choose 1–3 depending on your field.

- **Dentistry / healthcare:** Healthgrades, Zocdoc, WebMD, RateMDs  
- **Hospitality / tourism:** Tripadvisor, OpenTable, MICHELIN  
- **Professional / B2B:** Trustpilot, G2, Capterra

These sites often show up on the first page of Google for your category. Being listed here increases your authority in both search and AI systems.

## How Google and OpenAI Use Reviews

**Google**

- Prioritizes reviews in Google Business Profiles  
- Evaluates recency, quantity, and response rate  
- Considers overall brand “prominence” across the web

**OpenAI / ChatGPT**

- Aggregates data from trusted review platforms  
- Uses structured data (like schema markup) from your website  
- Surfaces businesses with consistent, verified, high-quality reviews

## Your 2025 Review Strategy

| Platform | Priority | What to Do | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Google Business Profile | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Get steady reviews weekly | Never incentivize or filter |
| Apple Business Connect | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Claim + update profile | Feeds Siri + iPhone results |
| Yelp | ⭐⭐⭐ | Keep it accurate + organic | Never ask directly |
| Industry Platforms | ⭐⭐⭐ | Choose 1–3 and maintain | Adds credibility |
| Facebook / Meta | ⭐ | Optional extra proof | Good for community trust |

## Best Practices

- ✅ Ask for reviews consistently — not in bursts  
- ✅ Reply to every review (shows engagement)  
- ✅ Use real customer stories — not generic text  
- ✅ Add testimonials and review schema to your website  
- ✅ Keep name, address, and phone identical across all platforms

## What Good Looks Like

- Average rating: **4.7–4.9 stars**  
- New reviews: **weekly or biweekly**  
- Responses: **within 48 hours**  
- Consistency: **same business info across Google, Apple, Yelp, and your site**  
- Real proof: **customer photos, service examples, and case studies**

## The Simple Rule

80% effort on Google, 10% on Apple, 10% on your top industry platforms. Yelp and others matter — but focus where visibility actually converts.
