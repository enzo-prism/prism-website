By Prism — Beautiful work. Measurable growth.

Most content fails not for lack of effort, but for lack of clarity. The win comes from a simple stack:

Your unique taste × one acute pain × free secrets → paid implementation.

## Your Filter Is the Moat

Anyone can mimic a format. No one can copy your taste—the filter you’ve built by watching a ton, building a ton, and spotting patterns others miss. That filter is the value. Ship it.

How to surface your filter:

- Write what you can only see after doing the reps.
- Show receipts (screens, numbers, process clips).
- Speak in the customer’s words, not yours.

## A Quick Story (Why This Works)

Years ago, I posted videos customizing characters in a superhero game (DC Universe Online). They blew up. Why? Unique taste + combinatorics. There were millions of possible styles, but people wanted a curator with a point of view to show the best paths.

Same rule in business content: be the curator with earned judgment. Your audience wants shortcuts informed by scars.

## Aim at One Pain (Say It in Their Words)

Skip “target markets.” Pick a specific person you want in your funnel and the one painful outcome they want:

- “I need 12 more qualified new-patient bookings this month.”
- “My trial users don’t activate in 24 hours.”

When the pain is sharp, the content writes itself.

## Give Away the Secrets (Seriously)

Hold nothing back in the what and why. Publish the framework, the steps, the checklists. That’s how you earn trust and attention. Then you sell the implementation:

- DIY: Templates, checklists, tiny playbooks.
- Tool: A product that does the workflow for them.
- DFY: You install it, wire it, and make it work.

Think checkout flow: buy the TV, optionally add Geek Squad to mount and configure it. Same value ladder. Same psychology.

## The Ladder (Structure Your Offers)

1. Free “secrets”: Weekly post/video that solves one slice of the pain.
2. Starter: Productized setup (template pack, quickstart build, or audit).
3. Pro: Recurring system (optimizations, dashboards, automations).
4. Flagship DFY: End-to-end implementation with KPIs and ownership.

## The Prism Checklist (Steal This)

- Filter statement: “We help [who] solve [pain] using [unfair advantage].”
- Pain proof: 3 screenshots/metrics that show the pain is real.
- Signature framework: Name your steps (3–5 max).
- Free preview cadence: One lesson per week—tight and visual.
- Offer stack: DIY → Tool → DFY, with clear scope and pricing.
- Loop velocity: Ship weekly. Measure clicks, replies, booked calls.

## Two Fast Plays

### Dental Practices

- Pain: Not enough qualified new-patient bookings.
- Free secret: Teach the “3-Call Funnel” (Google Business Profile → focused landing page → booked call) with copy/screens.
- Implementation: Prism installs the page, tracking, and reporting; weekly tweaks until cost-per-booked-call hits target.

### SaaS

- Pain: Trials don’t activate.
- Free secret: Share a “First-Win Onboarding” checklist (3 steps, under 10 minutes).
- Implementation: Prism rebuilds onboarding copy, in-app tour, and emails; measure time-to-first-value and activation lift.

## Mindset Reset

- Don’t hide the playbook—the doing is the moat.
- Don’t chase formats—ship your filter.
- Don’t boil the ocean—solve one pain repeatedly.

Give away the secrets. Sell the implementation.

If you want this system installed—calm, fast, measurable—Prism can run it end-to-end.
