Hey there, small business owners and startup founders! I'm Enzo, the founder of Prism, where we empower small businesses to grow using cutting-edge technology and design. If you're running a brick-and-mortar business like a dental practice or retail store, or you're a startup founder hustling to scale, you're in for a treat. Today, I'm diving into how ChatGPT's Agent Mode can transform the way you operate, and I'll compare it to Perplexity's Comet, a pricier alternative. Spoiler alert: the future of AI for small businesses is looking bright, and it's more accessible than you think!

## Why AI Matters for Small Businesses

We're living in the golden age of entrepreneurship. Technology, especially AI, is leveling the playing field, allowing small businesses to compete like never before. You don't need to be a tech wizard to harness AI's power—tools like ChatGPT Agent Mode are designed to make your life easier, whether you're managing day-to-day operations or planning strategic growth. At Prism, we work with brick-and-mortar businesses and startups to implement these tools, and the results are game-changing.

In this post, I'll walk you through a real-world example of using ChatGPT Agent Mode to streamline a task—apartment hunting for my team—and how it stacks up against Perplexity's Comet. Plus, I'll share why AI tools like these are must-haves for small business owners and startup founders.

## ChatGPT Agent Mode vs. Perplexity Comet: The Showdown

Recently, I tested ChatGPT Agent Mode (available for $20/month) against Perplexity Comet ($200/month) to see how they perform for practical business tasks. Here's the setup: I used both tools to find a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment with specific requirements (in-unit washer/dryer, proximity to a college for track training, easy parking, and AC) and to schedule tours. I also asked them to create and stylize a Google Sheet to track the apartment hunting process. Let's break it down.

### ChatGPT Agent Mode: Affordable and Powerful

ChatGPT Agent Mode is part of OpenAI's ecosystem, accessible for just $20/month. Here's what it did for my apartment hunting task:

**Deep Research and Clarification:** The agent asked clarifying questions to refine my needs, like pet-friendliness or floor preferences. I specified proximity to a college and parking for two cars, and it understood my requirements perfectly.

**Action-Oriented:** It scoured the web, found suitable listings, and reached out to a property on Rentable to schedule a tour using my contact information. It even sent a confirmation email, which I verified in my inbox. There was a minor hiccup—it initially misunderstood the tour date—but after a quick clarification, it nailed it.

**Google Sheet Creation:** I asked the agent to create a Google Sheet to track the apartment listings. It prompted me to log into my Google account (via the browser version, as the MacOS app couldn't handle this step). After a couple of nudges, it successfully created and populated the sheet with relevant data, adding filters and styling the columns for readability.

The experience wasn't flawless—it required some back-and-forth to get the Google Sheet just right—but it got the job done. For $20/month, this level of automation is a steal for small businesses.

### Perplexity Comet: Premium Price, Mixed Results

Perplexity Comet, at $200/month, is marketed as a premium agentic browser. It performed a similar apartment hunting task, running 24 searches and analyzing 197 sources in 22 minutes. The interface is sleek, offering a browser view of the agent's actions, and it successfully scheduled a tour. However, it struggled with more complex tasks like debugging a Google Analytics issue or creating a new tag in Google Tag Manager—it could read my screen but couldn't take direct action.

Surprisingly, ChatGPT Agent Mode matched or outperformed Comet in the apartment hunting task, despite being 10 times cheaper. Comet's premium price didn't translate to a proportionally better experience, which is a critical consideration for budget-conscious small businesses.

## Why ChatGPT Agent Mode Wins for Small Businesses

Here's why ChatGPT Agent Mode is a no-brainer for brick-and-mortar businesses and startups:

**Cost-Effective:** At $20/month, it's accessible to businesses of all sizes, unlike Comet's $200/month price tag.

**Actionable Automation:** From scheduling appointments to creating and organizing data in Google Sheets, ChatGPT Agent Mode can handle repetitive tasks, freeing you up to focus on high-level strategy.

**Brand Trust:** OpenAI's ChatGPT has become synonymous with AI. Your customers, employees, and partners are likely already familiar with it, making adoption seamless. Perplexity, while innovative, lacks the same brand recognition.

**Scalability:** As AI evolves, ChatGPT is becoming the "everything AI" platform, with features like Deep Research and Code Interpreter. This bundled approach means you get a suite of tools under one roof, simplifying your tech stack.

## Real-World Applications for Your Business

Imagine using ChatGPT Agent Mode to:

- **Optimize Operations:** Automate research for business credit cards, compare vendor contracts, or manage inventory tracking in Google Sheets.
- **Streamline Marketing:** Draft social media content, analyze campaign performance, or identify partnership opportunities to boost revenue.
- **Save Time:** Handle administrative tasks like scheduling, data entry, or customer follow-ups, so you can focus on strategic growth.

At Prism, we're already seeing our clients—dental practices, retail stores, and startup founders—use AI to eliminate day-to-day "fires" and think long-term. For example, instead of manually researching financial tools, an agent can analyze options and present optimized choices, saving hours of work.

## The Bigger Picture: AI's First-Mover Advantage

OpenAI's dominance in AI isn't just about technology—it's about mindshare. When people think AI, they think ChatGPT. This brand trust, combined with a superior product at a lower price, makes it tough for competitors like Perplexity to keep up. As a small business owner, you don't need to juggle multiple tools or pay premium prices. A single, reliable platform like ChatGPT can handle everything from personal tasks (like apartment hunting) to complex business workflows.

Looking ahead, AI agents will only get smarter. In a few months or years, we'll see swarms of agents managing entire business functions—marketing, finance, customer service—you name it. Early adopters will have a massive advantage, capturing value as these tools evolve.
