<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">1. A once-in-a-decade traffic shock</h2>
<p class="mb-6">At <strong>Cannes Lions</strong> this June, Cloudflare CEO <strong>Matthew Prince</strong> shared numbers that rattled every marketer in the room:</p>

<table class="w-full text-left mb-6">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="py-2 pr-4">Platform</th>
      <th class="py-2 pr-4">2015</th>
      <th class="py-2 pr-4">Jan&nbsp;2025</th>
      <th class="py-2 pr-4">Jul&nbsp;2025</th>
      <th class="py-2">Change<br/>in last&nbsp;6&nbsp;mo</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="py-2 pr-4">Google pages scraped for 1 visitor</td>
      <td class="py-2 pr-4">2&nbsp;:&nbsp;1</td>
      <td class="py-2 pr-4">6&nbsp;:&nbsp;1</td>
      <td class="py-2 pr-4">18&nbsp;:&nbsp;1</td>
      <td class="py-2">3× worse</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="py-2 pr-4">% of queries resolved on Google itself</td>
      <td class="py-2 pr-4">-</td>
      <td class="py-2 pr-4">75&nbsp;%</td>
      <td class="py-2 pr-4">≈&nbsp;90&nbsp;%</td>
      <td class="py-2">+15&nbsp;pp</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="py-2 pr-4">OpenAI pages scraped for 1 visitor</td>
      <td class="py-2 pr-4">-</td>
      <td class="py-2 pr-4">250&nbsp;:&nbsp;1</td>
      <td class="py-2 pr-4">1,500&nbsp;:&nbsp;1</td>
      <td class="py-2">6× worse</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="mb-6"><em>Prince's blunt summary:</em> "AI Overviews are vacuuming up your copy, answering the query, and keeping the user."</p>
<p class="mb-6">This is the biggest erosion of the "you create content > we send traffic" handshake since Google launched PageRank. And it's accelerating.</p>

<hr class="my-8" />

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">2. Why this matters to dentists and local SMBs</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 mb-6">
  <li>
    <p class="mb-2 font-medium">Local intent still leaks clicks-but the window is shrinking.</p>
    <p>For searches like "dentist near me," Google sticks a map-pack on top. That's the one slice of real estate AI summaries can't replace yet, making Google Business Profile (GBP) health and reviews non-negotiable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="mb-2 font-medium">Blog-driven organic funnels are losing oxygen.</p>
    <p>A decade's worth of evergreen posts used to pull long-tail traffic. Now they're training data for AI answers that never reach your site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="mb-2 font-medium">Paid ad costs will rise.</p>
    <p>As organic fades, everyone crowds into Google Ads and Meta, bidding up CPCs. Surviving means better micro-audience precision and higher onsite conversion rates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="mb-2 font-medium">First-party data is your oxygen mask.</p>
    <p>Email, SMS, loyalty programs, treatment-plan portals-anything that lets you talk to patients or customers directly-is now an asset that AI cannot scrape or steal.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">4. What clients will see inside the new Prism Dashboard</h2>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
  <li>Rolling <strong>AI Share-of-Voice</strong> metric-how often your brand surfaces in Google SGE and ChatGPT citations</li>
  <li><strong>GBP Interactions:</strong> calls, website taps, direction requests</li>
  <li><strong>Direct Conversions:</strong> booked appointments, form fills, live-chat handoffs</li>
  <li>De-emphasized vanity metrics like raw organic sessions-because the game has changed</li>
</ul>

<hr class="my-8" />

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">5. Immediate next steps</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 mb-6">
  <li><strong>Dentists:</strong> Shoot us two fresh chair-side photos each month. Authentic imagery boosts GBP and ignites Reels.</li>
  <li><strong>E-commerce & services clients:</strong> Add a single-step email/SMS capture on your hero section (we'll wire it).</li>
  <li><strong>All clients:</strong> Approve the micro-audience pilot budget in your July review-data now beats guesses later.</li>
  <li><strong>Internal to Prism:</strong> We'll re-audit top 50 queries per client for AI Overview impact and adjust content calendars accordingly.</li>
</ol>

<hr class="my-8" />

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The bottom line</h2>
<p class="mb-6">AI hasn't just moved the goalposts; it built a new stadium. Traffic that once trickled into your blog is now absorbed by answer boxes and chat windows. But local intent, first-party data, and hyper-targeted creative remain uncannily human.</p>
<p class="mb-6">Prism is already steering into that reality-so your practice or business stays visible, valuable, and one step ahead of the collapse.</p>
