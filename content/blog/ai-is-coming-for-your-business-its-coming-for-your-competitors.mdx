**By Enzo Sison, Founder of Prism** | February 2026

I've been thinking a lot lately about what separates the businesses that will thrive in the next five years from the ones that will quietly fade. It has less to do with budget or industry and almost everything to do with how founders think about leverage. Here's how Prism is thinking about it and what we're doing about it right now.

A few weeks ago I was listening to a Naval Ravikant podcast on AI. Naval said something that stuck with me: the best way to think about AI tools right now is that they're a motorcycle for the mind. Faster than walking. More powerful than anything we've had before. But you still need someone to drive it, to decide where to go, to hit the accelerator, and to know when to brake.

That framing matters for small and medium sized business owners in a very specific way. Because the question isn't whether AI will change how marketing and growth work. It already has. The question is: who's driving?

## The Problem with How Most Agencies Are Using AI

Here's what a lot of agencies are doing right now: they're using AI to produce more of the same thing, faster. More blog posts. More ad copy. More generic social content. They're treating AI as a content printer and they're selling the printouts as strategy.

That's not leverage. That's just cheaper mediocrity at scale. And when every agency can produce mediocre content cheaply, mediocre content becomes worthless. One Adweek analysis put it plainly: content volume and variation are becoming close to free, which means "good enough" creative collapses in value. The businesses that win are not the ones producing more. They're the ones producing better, with smarter systems behind it.

What actually creates value for a growing business isn't volume. It's precision: the right message, to the right person, at the right moment, in a way that builds genuine trust. That's a judgment problem, not a content problem. And judgment is exactly what AI, on its own, doesn't have.

> *"The best application for a given use case still tends to win the entire category. Nobody wants the average thing. People want the best thing that does the job."*
> Naval Ravikant

This is precisely what we think about at Prism. Whether you're running a consulting firm, an ecommerce brand, a B2B company, or a service business, you're not competing with everyone in the world. You're competing for trust, attention, and reputation within your specific market. That's a human game. AI is how you play it better.

## The Shift That's Actually Happening Right Now

Most people think of AI as a smarter autocomplete. What's actually happening is something much more significant: AI is moving from assistant to operator.

The shift started quietly. Tools like Claude Code and GitHub Copilot began helping developers write faster. Then they started writing entire features. Then entire applications. By the end of 2025, roughly 85% of developers were regularly using AI coding tools, and an estimated 41% of worldwide code was already AI generated. The models are not just getting more capable. They are getting more capable faster than most people expect.

The same shift is now happening across marketing, sales, and operations. What used to require a team of specialists to set up, monitor, and adjust is increasingly being handled by autonomous AI agents that run continuous loops: watching live performance data, making decisions, applying changes, and learning from results without waiting for a human to intervene.

The global agentic AI market was valued at around $7.8 billion entering 2026 and is forecast to exceed $52 billion by 2030. Gartner predicts that 40% of enterprise applications will embed AI agents by end of 2026, up from less than 5% in 2025. These are not numbers about a trend that is coming. They are numbers about a transition that is already underway, and most small and medium businesses have barely started adapting to it.

## What AI Agents Actually Do for a Growing Business

Here is what is changing in practical terms, and why it matters for businesses like yours.

**Advertising is becoming a live, self optimizing system.** Traditional ad management meant reviewing performance weekly or monthly and making manual adjustments. AI agents now monitor campaign performance in real time and autonomously shift budgets across platforms, pause underperforming creatives, and reallocate spend based on live conversion data. An agent sees that one audience is converting at half the cost on a different channel, and it moves the budget before the day is over. No meeting required. No waiting for a report. For ecommerce brands, B2B companies, and service businesses running paid acquisition, this kind of continuous optimization used to require a dedicated specialist. It increasingly does not.

**Social media and content is moving from scheduled posts to intelligent signals.** The next generation of content systems do not just publish on a calendar. They analyze what is resonating in real time, identify which formats and angles are driving engagement, and feed that insight back into what gets created next. In a multi agent setup, one agent is analyzing competitor content, another is generating variations of what is working, and a third is updating performance benchmarks, all running simultaneously. A small team of three people can operate with the output of a much larger one.

**Sales funnels are getting a voice.** This is the one that surprises most founders when they first see it. ElevenLabs, the AI voice platform, just raised $500 million at an $11 billion valuation after closing 2025 with over $330 million in annual recurring revenue. Companies like Deutsche Telekom, Square, and Revolut are using its technology for customer support, conversational commerce, and inbound sales. What that means in practice: AI voice agents can now qualify leads, handle initial sales conversations, follow up with prospects, and move people through a funnel around the clock, at scale, in a voice that sounds genuinely human. For a consulting firm that relies on discovery calls, or an ecommerce brand dealing with high inbound volume, or a B2B company trying to scale outreach without scaling headcount, this changes the economics of sales entirely.

**Engineering and product teams are building faster than ever before.** For B2B companies and tech focused businesses, the coding side of this shift is just as significant. AI coding agents like Claude Code can now handle multi step development tasks autonomously, managing cross project changes, running tests, monitoring CI/CD pipelines, and iterating on complex codebases without constant human direction. Anthropic's own 2026 Agentic Coding Trends report describes engineers shifting from hands on coding to orchestrating AI agents, setting goals and validating results while the agents execute. This means B2B software companies that embrace this model can ship faster, reduce technical debt more efficiently, and bring smaller teams to bear on problems that previously required much larger engineering organizations.

## How Prism Is Building Around This

We help clients with websites, local SEO, paid advertising, content, and social media. All of these categories are being transformed by the shift I just described, and we are building our systems accordingly.

The way we think about it: every deliverable we produce has two layers. The mechanical layer, the research, the production, the formatting, and the distribution, is increasingly handled by AI systems running in loops, watching data, and applying what they learn. The meaningful layer, the strategy, the positioning, the creative judgment, and the decision making about what actually moves the needle for a specific business in a specific market, is where our team's time goes.

That separation is not just an efficiency play. It changes what we can offer. When our team is not buried in production work, we can go much deeper on strategy for every client. When our campaigns are running on systems that watch live data and self optimize, our clients are not waiting for a monthly review to find out what is working. When we integrate voice and conversational AI into a sales funnel, a client's leads are being responded to and qualified immediately, not sitting in a queue.

### Niche Depth Over Broad Coverage

Generic agencies that serve everyone with the same playbook are going to get squeezed hard. AI tools will handle the generic work. What survives is genuine specialization: deep knowledge of how your specific buyer thinks, what they search for, what convinces them to act, and what keeps them coming back.

A consulting firm needs to demonstrate authority and build trust before a prospect will engage. An ecommerce brand needs to build desire, reduce friction, and recover abandoned intent at exactly the right moment. A B2B company needs to generate qualified pipeline and shorten sales cycles. These are completely different problems requiring completely different approaches. The same AI generated strategy does not solve all three. Real expertise does. And real expertise, paired with AI leverage, compounds.

## The Entrepreneurial Advantage

Here's the framing I find most useful for founders. Naval argues that no entrepreneur is worried about AI taking their job because entrepreneurship is, by definition, the act of doing something difficult that requires genuine agency and creative judgment. AI is their ally, not their threat.

Running a business is entrepreneurship. You're not filling a slot someone else defined. You're building something, serving customers, making judgment calls every day that require real expertise and real relationships. AI cannot replace that. But AI can dramatically amplify it.

The Adweek analysis of where this is all heading is pointed: the dividing line in 2026 is between businesses that are AI enhanced and those that are truly AI native. AI native businesses do not just use more tools. They organize around AI. They treat autonomy, data flows, and the speed of decisions as competitive advantages. They are not running marketing like a relay race between disconnected team members. They are running it like a control room overseeing systems that operate around the clock.

The founders who think clearly about this, who see AI as leverage rather than threat or magic wand, are going to pull ahead. The ones who wait, or who hand the keys entirely to an AI tool with no strategic direction behind it, are going to find that their competitors moved while they weren't paying attention.

The businesses that win in the next five years won't necessarily be the ones with the biggest budgets. They'll be the ones that understood early that AI is a multiplier and that what it multiplies is your existing judgment, strategy, and positioning. If your strategy is weak, AI will produce more of it faster. If your strategy is sharp, AI will compound it in ways that weren't possible two years ago.

## What We're Building Toward

I'll be honest: Prism is in the middle of a significant buildout of our internal systems. We're investing heavily in the infrastructure that lets us deliver more insight, faster, with more consistency and without losing the human judgment layer that actually makes the difference for clients.

Our goal is to be the agency that, five years from now, our clients look back on and say: "They saw where things were going and they built for it." Not the agency that was still sending generic reports and running the same playbook while the world changed around them.

That means being a genuine growth partner and not just a vendor. Telling you what your business needs to hear, not just what you want to hear. Leading with strategy and using AI as the engine that executes it at a level that wasn't possible before.

That's the Prism approach. And we're just getting started.
