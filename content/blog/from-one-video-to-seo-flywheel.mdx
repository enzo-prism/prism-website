## The Big Idea

Every founder knows they should **"create once, distribute everywhere."**  
In this 60-minute live build (full video embedded at the bottom) I put that mantra to work—turning **one YouTube video** into:

1. A polished blog post (you're reading it).  
2. Social clips, tweets, and LinkedIn carousels.  
3. A production-ready Markdown page auto-deployed to Vercel.

All with **Cursor**, **OpenAI Codex**, **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, and Vercel.

## TL;DR – What You'll Learn

| Persona | Key Take-away |
|---------|---------------|
| **Business owner / founder** | A repeatable content engine that compounds organic traffic without hiring extra writers. |
| **Developer** | Tool-by-tool look at Cursor vs Codex vs Gemini + a hard-won lesson in escaping HTML inside Markdown. |
| **Marketer / SEO lead** | A checklist for turning raw transcripts into schema-friendly, AI-search-ready blog posts in < 30 min. |

## 1 · Tool Stack & Workflow

| Step | Tool(s) | What Happens | Why It Matters |
|------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Transcript export | YouTube → Cursor | Pull auto-captions into Cursor AI chat. | Raw, timestamped copy to mine. |
| First-pass draft | Cursor AI | "Summarize into a 1 200-word article with H2s." | Spoken word → web-ready prose. |
| SEO refinement | Gemini 2.5 Pro | "Rewrite for AI search; add FAQ schema." | Future-proof for SGE/AI overviews. |
| Merge & deploy | Cursor ↔ GitHub ↔ Vercel | Commit Markdown, preview, hot-fix duplicate H1. | Real feedback loop, zero guesswork. |
| Micro-content | Codex agent + ffmpeg | Auto-timestamp highlights → vertical shorts. | Feeds social channels automatically. |

## 2 · Clean, Actionable Lessons

### For Business Owners & Founders  
- **One asset, many surfaces.** Spawn > 10 pieces from one video.  
- **Debug live, sell later.** Transparency > perfect highlight reels.  
- **Process over perfection.** Capture → polish → publish today.

### For Marketers & SEO Leads  
- **Front-load outcomes in titles.** e.g. "Fix Blog SEO with AI—Live."  
- **Add chapter markers.** YouTube auto-indexes them in SERPs.  
- **Embed `VideoObject` schema.** Appear in AI overviews first.

### For Developers  
1. **Cursor vs Codex vs Gemini**  
   - *Cursor* → repo-aware edits.  
   - *Codex* → boilerplate generation.  
   - *Gemini* → summarize multi-modal context.  
2. **Escape early, escape often.** HTML in Markdown will double-render.  
3. **Preview URLs save face.** Stage on Vercel before public launch.

## 3 · 10-Minute Implementation Cheat Sheet

1. Record a 5–10 min explainer video on a core problem you solve.  
2. Export auto-generated transcript.  
3. Paste into Cursor → prompt: "Draft 1 200-word blog post with H2s + bullets."  
4. Drop draft into Gemini → "Optimize for AI search; add FAQ schema."  
5. Commit Markdown → Vercel preview.  
6. Fix headings, links, escaping.  
7. In Cursor: "Cut three 45-sec highlight clips with captions."  
8. Schedule clips on X/LinkedIn linking back here.  
9. Add `VideoObject` & `Article` schema in CMS.  
10. Review analytics in 2 weeks; double-down on the best channel.
