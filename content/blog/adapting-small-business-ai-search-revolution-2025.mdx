  <MobileParagraph emphasized>
    Hey there, small business owners and marketers! If you're running a local shop, an e-commerce side hustle, or a service-based gig like consulting or freelancing, you've probably noticed something funky with your website traffic lately. Google searches aren't sending as many visitors your way, and it's not because people stopped looking for what you offer. The culprit? AI-powered search features, like Google's AI Overviews, which are answering questions right on the results page—without anyone clicking through to your site.
  </MobileParagraph>

  <MobileParagraph>
    As of mid-2025, studies show that organic clicks from Google have dropped by an average of 15%, with some industries (like health and wellness) seeing declines up to 30%. Tools like ChatGPT are grabbing a tiny slice (1-2%) of search traffic, but the real thief is Google's own AI summaries handling simple queries. The good news? You don't need a big budget or a tech team to fight back. In this post, I'll break down practical, AI-first strategies inspired by experts like Nate Jones (from his recent insights on AI and SEO). These are tailored for small businesses—easy to implement with free tools, a bit of time, and some smart content tweaks. Let's turn AI from a traffic stealer into your secret ally.

<MobileContentSection title="Why AI Is Hijacking Your Clicks (And Why It Matters for Small Biz)">
  <MobileParagraph>
    First, a quick reality check: Google processes billions of searches daily, but AI summaries now dominate for "quick fact" or "how-to" queries. For example:
  </MobileParagraph>

  <MobileList
    items={[
      "Searching 'best coffee roaster for home use'? AI might summarize top options without linking out.",
      "Asking 'symptoms of a common cold'? Medical sites lose clicks as AI pulls answers directly."
    ]}
    type="bullet"
  />

  <MobileParagraph>
    For small businesses, this hits hard. If you're a boutique coffee seller or a local health coach, those lost clicks mean fewer leads, sales, and brand awareness. But here's the shift: AI isn't just a search engine—it's your new "reader." Large language models (LLMs) like those powering Google or ChatGPT scan the web and "parameterize" brands, meaning they treat your business like a data point in their vast knowledge base. The goal? Make your brand pop up naturally in AI responses, even if users don't click through immediately.
