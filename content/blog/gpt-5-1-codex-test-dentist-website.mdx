  transcript={`[00:00:00] So, I'm going to be kicking off a series where I'm just going to be testing these models so that you don't have to.
[00:00:07] We're going to use this control key—basically a prompt to create a website—and we'll use the exact same prompt for Codex CLI 5.1 today and for models like Gemini 3 or Grok 5 as they land.
[00:00:46] I've already got a folder called 5.1-test, so I'll cd into it, call Codex, allow access, set approvals to full, and hand over this prompt.
[00:01:30] It took 5 minutes and 16 seconds, and then we'll always tell it to start localhost so we can test the URL for each future run.
[00:02:08] It didn't struggle starting localhost this time, which is funny because sometimes it does.
[00:02:16] You can see the prompt result—the model really likes these gradients, and I've noticed thin, custom-looking icons that feel a little off.
[00:02:55] There are spacing issues throughout; it's a services page but a lot of times the button text contrast versus the background is pretty bad.
[00:03:32] I did ask it to make a full blog and it didn't really do that, and the form styling always seems messed up like this.
[00:03:56] Overall it's good for desktop, but once I test the breakpoint the nav bar kind of falls apart and the mobile view looks weird.
[00:04:44] Hopefully we can run Gemini CLI and others soon to compare, because this is still far from perfect even though it's not a bad skeleton—let me know what you think.`}

## Why we test AI website builders this way

Every new model claims it can ship perfect sites in minutes. Reality looks different when you run the exact same brief without hand-holding. Dentists, clinics, and local operators care about five things that move revenue:

- **speed** – can the model finish fast enough to matter inside an agency sprint?
- **accuracy** – does it follow instructions or drift into irrelevant layouts?
- **quality** – are spacing, icons, copy blocks, and animations client-ready?
- **responsiveness** – does the site survive phones, tablets, and wide desktops?
- **code health** – is the output modular and maintainable or a one-file tangle?

So Prism built a canonical benchmark: one control prompt, identical execution, raw results published. No cherry-picked screenshots. No second chances. Just data.

## The prompt every model must pass

> **Model Test Key 🔑**  
> Build a complete website for a dental practice named “Prism Dental,” owned by Dr. Enzo in San Francisco, CA.  
> **Requirements**  
> – Create 10 fully designed pages, including Home, About, Contact, New Patients, and detailed service pages for General Dentistry, Cosmetic Dentistry, Restorative Dentistry, Orthodontics, Emergency Dentistry, and Preventive Care.  
> – Include a full blog system with categories and example posts.  
> – Ship a sleek, modern, elegant, minimalistic visual system with clean typography, generous spacing, and modern line-style dental icons.  
> – Make every page fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
> – Give each service page an overview, symptoms/indications, benefits, procedure steps, FAQ, pricing guidance, and a clear CTA to book an appointment.  
> – Generate all text content, section layouts, CTAs, and image descriptions.  
> – Prioritize a premium, high-end, trustworthy, tech-forward feel.  
> – Output the entire site in a clean, organized structure with page-by-page content, components, and meta titles/descriptions.

If a model struggles with that spec, it won’t survive a real dental client with HIPAA context, multi-location routing, and agency-level polish demands.

## Test setup (Codex CLI v5.1 High)

1. **New folder** – spin up `5.1-test/` so the run is reproducible.
2. **Provide approvals** – give the model filesystem access inside Codex CLI.
3. **Paste the control prompt** – no added context, no manual clean-up.
4. **Measure generation time** – stopwatch from enter to final log.
5. **Launch `start localhost`** – inspect the unedited build on desktop + mobile.
6. **Score design + code** – capture successes, failures, and file hierarchy quality.

This same checklist will power upcoming runs on Gemini 3, Claude Code, Grok 5, Llama 4, and every major release.

## GPT-5.1 Codex (High) results

### 1. generation speed

- **5 minutes 16 seconds** end-to-end.
- Fast enough for ideation and internal sprints, still slower than smaller tuned models we use for scaffolding.

### 2. ui & visual design quality

GPT-5.1 clearly prefers heavy gradients, ultra-thin custom icons, and minimalist whitespace. The skeleton is promising, but production quality issues stack up quickly:

- custom icons looked hand-drawn and didn’t align with dental branding norms.
- buttons shipped light text on light backgrounds—low contrast, low accessibility.
- spacing between hero, services, and testimonial sections oscillated wildly.
- form styling felt unfinished: mismatched inputs, uneven padding, missing states.

Verdict: usable starting point, but it needs manual adjustments before any dentist sees it.

### 3. mobile responsiveness

Desktop layouts held together, yet the mobile experience collapsed:

- nav collapsed into a menu that still displayed the full horizontal list (double content).
- stacked sections overlapped because padding didn’t adjust at small breakpoints.
- hero copy clipped beneath the fold, forcing awkward scroll jumps.

Any clinic depending on mobile bookings would lose leads instantly.

### 4. structural completeness

The prompt requested a home page, services, blog, contact flow, and responsive layout. GPT-5.1 delivered a partial win:

- ✅ hero, services overview, testimonials, CTA forms rendered.
- ❌ no real blog system—just a placeholder list.
- ❌ sitemap lacked category routing or breadcrumbs.
- ❌ code lived in a single directory with minimal component separation.

Bottom line: it does the bare minimum, not a launchable architecture.

### 5. is it good enough for real websites?

**What GPT-5.1 Codex does well**

- ship a functional starting point for designers and engineers.
- explore layout directions quickly so humans can pick the best path.
- produce HTML/CSS fragments you can paste into an existing design system.
- accelerate agency workflows by 30–50% when paired with human QA.

**What it cannot handle (yet)**

- delivering polish that makes a paying client say “ship it.”
- managing responsive edge cases or complex nav states without oversight.
- building scalable component architecture with routing, blog feeds, or localization.
- shipping SEO-ready metadata, schema, and accessibility without manual fixes.

Our verdict: **5/10** for production readiness—fantastic prototyping fuel, not a stand-alone solution.

## Why this matters for dentists and local clinics

Dentists do not buy “cool AI demos.” They buy predictably booked hygiene chairs, filled operatories, and high-trust first impressions. GPT-5.1 Codex moves you closer to that goal by shortening the revision cycle, helping you test hero copy faster, and spinning up service pages for Google’s reviewers. But without human designers + SEO leads, you still risk off-brand visuals, ADA issues, and low Core Web Vitals.

Agencies that pair AI acceleration with real creative direction, compliance, and local SEO instrumentation will beat everyone else. That is Prism’s operating system.

## Agency POV: how we’re using GPT-5.1 today

- leverage it for **rapid mockups** so clients see something tangible in day one workshops.
- let it handle **content generation** (FAQs, location blurbs) that strategists then edit.
- use it for **faster revisions** on padding, typography, and animation concepts.
- keep humans in the loop for **responsive QA, CMS wiring, schema, and analytics**.

In other words: AI accelerates the heavy lift, Prism supplies the taste, systems, and accountability.

## What’s next in the benchmark series

Gemini 3, Claude Code, Grok 5, Llama 4, and the next Codex releases will all run through this same script—full transparency, same rubric, side-by-side comparisons. Subscribe if you want to see how each stack handles local business reality.

## FAQ: real answers for dentists exploring AI sites

### Can GPT-5.1 build a full website from scratch?

It can generate a strong starting point, but you still need humans to refine UI, accessibility, and multi-page routing before launch.

### Is Codex v5.1 good for dentist websites?

Yes for prototyping layouts or content quickly; no if you expect a polished, compliance-ready website without editing.

### How long does GPT-5.1 Codex take to generate a website?

Our test completed in **5 minutes 16 seconds** from prompt to final file output.

### Does AI-generated code have SEO built in?

Not reliably. You must still handle metadata, structured data, speed budgets, and accessibility by hand.

### Can AI replace a web design agency?

Not even close today. Agencies that blend AI speed with human design, SEO, and CRO expertise will win.
