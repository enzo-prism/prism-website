<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">Dear Friend,</p>

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">This is for you, straight from my core. If you're grinding through a system that's draining your soul, wondering if you're enough, hear me out. I've been there—lost in a machine that made me feel broken, but I fought through and carved my own path.</p>

<p class="mb-6 font-semibold">The education system and that "safe" career ladder? It's a psyop to keep you small, compliant, chasing someone else's script. Don't buy it. Break free. Fight for what sets you ablaze.</p>

<p class="mb-6">Let me show you how I did it, and why you can too.</p>

## My Journey Through the Machine

<p class="mb-6">School hit me like a truck early on. K-8 at St. Raymond Catholic in Menlo Park—faith, structure, community on the surface. But the work? Brutal. Math blurred into a haze. Reading comprehension was like wading through quicksand. History? A mess of facts I couldn't care about.</p>

<p class="mb-6">I struggled hard, always lagging behind classmates who seemed to coast. I felt dumb, my focus shot compared to theirs. It wasn't me—it was the system wiring me to feel defective. I pushed through, not for love of learning, but to fit in, to claim a spot with the crowd.</p>

### The Pressure Cooker

<p class="mb-6">Bellarmine College Prep cranked up the pressure. Jesuit rigor, elite college prep vibes—supposedly the golden ticket. Same story: I struggled, tanked tests, barely stayed afloat.</p>

<p class="mb-6">Then Cal Poly for engineering, Computer Science with UX design. That's where it got ugly. Five years of grind, retaking so many classes because my grades in those engineering courses were trash. Calc 3? A disaster.</p>

### The Breaking Point

<p class="mb-6">Bombed the midterm, dragged myself to office hours. Other students were there, and when I admitted I still didn't get the explanation, the professor snapped, yelling, "How do you not get this?!" in front of everyone.</p>

<p class="mb-6">That stung deep. I felt hopeless—should I ditch engineering, transfer schools, or just quit? "I don't belong," I thought.</p>

<p class="mb-6">Add in D1 track and field at Cal Poly—insanely demanding, even though I didn't start competing internationally for the Philippines until after college—and keeping up was brutal. My peers weren't balancing grueling practices; they had time to study.</p>

## Building While Breaking

<p class="mb-6">But something else kept me going: I loved building stuff. Always have.</p>

<p class="mb-6">Back in middle school, September 26, 2010, I dropped my first YouTube gaming video. Through the chaos—high school, college—I kept at it: livestreams, partnerships, scaling to over 4 million views. The cash bought my high school ride, a 2008 Toyota Prius.</p>

### Self-Taught Everything

<p class="mb-6">Self-taught everything: PC builds for streaming, graphic design, video editing, motion graphics, marketing, community management, contract reviews. Landed two summer internships at Apple during college—at the time, the most valuable company in the world.</p>

<p class="mb-6">They valued my YouTube gaming hustle from when I was younger and my track and field journey way more than any classroom stuff. I was hesitant at first, scared to speak up or share ideas, just like in my engineering classes—didn't want them to realize I wasn't "good enough" for Apple.</p>

<p class="mb-6 font-semibold">But the people I worked with? They drew me out, showed me my ideas and perspective had real value. It shattered that old belief that I was stupid, not enough.</p>

<p class="mb-6">Those internships were transformational, some of the best experiences of my life. Now? My startup, 2.5 years strong, uses AI to boost brick-and-mortar shops—more leads, conversions, lifetime value.</p>

## The System is a Psyop

<p class="mb-6">Why am I laying this out? The system—school to corporate treadmill—is a psyop to box you in. Buy it, and you're trapped.</p>

<p class="mb-6">Who profits? Corporations want compliant workers who follow orders, not disruptors who question. They skim your life's output while dangling "stability." Politicians push empty "reforms"—tests, loans—to keep voters distracted, the machine humming.</p>

<p class="mb-6">Unions shield teachers by seniority, not skill, breeding stagnation. Banks feast on student debt, chaining you to soul-sucking jobs to pay it off. Elite schools bank on alumni cash from those who play the game.</p>

## The Broken Incentives

<p class="mb-6 font-semibold">Incentives drive it all—and they're broken by design.</p>

### Teacher Pay: Experience Over Excellence

<p class="mb-6">Take teacher pay: It's based on years served and fancy degrees, not how well kids learn or grow. Why? Unions fought for it to protect jobs, but it means bad teachers stick around, draining passion from classrooms while top ones burn out unrewarded.</p>

<p class="mb-6">The psyop here? It pretends "experience" equals value, but it stifles innovation—kids get rote drills, not real skills, turning school into a soul-draining factory line where curiosity dies and conformity thrives.</p>

### Funding: Rich Get Richer

<p class="mb-6">Or funding: Tied to local property taxes, so rich neighborhoods get shiny labs and poor ones get scraps. Why like this? Politicians won't equalize it—hits wealthy voters who fund campaigns.</p>

<p class="mb-6">Result? Inequality baked in, a psyop selling "meritocracy" while ensuring the rich stay ahead.</p>

### Testing: Chasing Numbers, Not Growth

<p class="mb-6">High-stakes tests? Schools chase scores for federal bucks, narrowing curricula to bubble-filling, ignoring creativity or life skills. It's the opposite of helpful—kids emerge stressed, unprepared, hating learning.</p>

### Tenure: The Crown Jewel of Mediocrity

<p class="mb-6">And tenure? That's the crown jewel of broken incentives. In education, after a short probation (1-5 years), teachers get near-lifetime job security—hard to fire even for poor performance.</p>

<p class="mb-6">It started to protect academic freedom, shielding educators from arbitrary dismissal for controversial ideas. But now? It contributes to complacency: No fear of consequences means less drive to innovate or improve.</p>

<p class="mb-6">Studies show post-tenure productivity can dip, with underperformers protected while schools suffer. Why no tenure in private businesses? Companies need agility—fire fast for bad fits, hire innovators to adapt to markets and serve customers.</p>

<p class="mb-6">Without it, businesses foster performance cultures, rewarding results over time served. That drives innovation: Employees push boundaries to add value, or they're out.</p>

<p class="mb-6 font-semibold">In education, tenure shields the status quo, hindering student-centered changes. Businesses treat customers (us) as kings; schools? Students are the product, churned out for the economy, not empowered.</p>

<p class="mb-6">The psyop sells tenure as "protection," but it locks in mediocrity, blocking fresh ideas that could actually help kids thrive.</p>

## Why Nothing Changes

<p class="mb-6">Why don't they fix it? Vested interests: Change threatens power.</p>

<p class="mb-6">Teachers, admins, parents—they're plugged into the matrix, drones serving a beast that ate their dreams long ago. As kids, we're told obey parents and teachers, but they're cultists, believing they're "helping" by pushing this slave mindset.</p>

<p class="mb-6">They sell their own children into it, forcefully—environment shapes worldview, actions, results. Prove the system's broken? It shatters their reality. They fight to pretend it's valuable because admitting it's a drain would mean their lives were wasted.</p>

<p class="mb-6 font-semibold">But it's the opposite: It crushes spirits, spits out workers for the grind, not free thinkers.</p>

## AI Changes Everything

<p class="mb-6">AI flips this. Tools like adaptive learning apps personalize education, rewarding real mastery over compliance. My startup uses AI to solve real problems—imagine that in schools: AI tutors spotting your strengths early, not yelling at weaknesses.</p>

<p class="mb-6">It disrupts the psyop—why change when control pays?</p>

## Your Breaking Point

<p class="mb-6 font-semibold">Don't fall for it. I fought—built through failures, chased creation over compliance.</p>

<p class="mb-6">The degree came, but the real wins? Skills, ventures, freedom. The psyop screamed quit; I outworked it.</p>

<p class="mb-6">See the traps: That doubt? It's the system, not you. Feed what sparks you—hustles, passions. Solve real problems. Find allies who lift, not crush. Your fire is your weapon.</p>

<p class="mb-6 font-semibold">One step today: kick off that idea you've shelved. What's it gonna be? Think it, then do it.</p>

<p class="mb-6">We're in this together. Break the mold.</p>

<p class="mb-6">With fight,<br />Enzo Sison</p>
