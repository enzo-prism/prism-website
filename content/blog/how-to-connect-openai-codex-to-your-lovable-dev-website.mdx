Loveable.dev gets your site from zero to launch-ready fast. But when you need fine-grained control over code, design tweaks, or integrations, you need a developer-grade workspace that still respects what Loveable already built. That’s why we pair Loveable with OpenAI Codex for our Prism clients—it keeps the AI-powered speed while giving us GitHub-native editing and review.

Here’s the exact process we use in-house so you can replicate it yourself.

## ⚙️ Step 1: Prepare Your Loveable Project

Before connecting anything, make sure Loveable has shipped at least one saved version of your site. That gives Codex a stable codebase to work with.

**Confirm you have:**

- A generated Loveable.dev project that reflects your latest prompts.
- At least one saved version of the code or design.

## 🔗 Step 2: Connect Loveable to GitHub

Inside the Loveable dashboard, open your project settings and follow the GitHub transfer flow:

1. Click **Connect Project**.
2. Choose **GitHub**.
3. Pick the right organization.
4. Hit **Transfer**.

Loveable will provision a GitHub repository and surface the repo URL—copy it, because you’ll need it for Codex.

## 💻 Step 3: Set Up an OpenAI Codex Environment

With your repo live, hop into OpenAI Codex (via chat.openai.com or your workspace):

- Go to **Manage Environments**.
- Click **Create New Environment**.
- Choose **GitHub Repository** and select the Loveable-linked repo (in our walkthrough it’s `dental-referral-buddy`).
- Confirm the environment name and defaults.

## 🌐 Step 4: Enable Agent Internet Access

During environment creation, toggle on **Agent Internet Access**. That allows Codex to pull in current context or docs without you manually pasting links.

Once everything looks right, click **Create Environment**.

## 🧠 Step 5: Start Prompting Inside Codex

Open the environment and begin prompting. You now have the best of both worlds: Loveable’s generated foundation plus Codex’s GitHub-aware AI editor.

In our demo we prompted:

```
Change the site’s main color from green to blue.
```

Codex identified the correct files, made the update, and pushed commits back to GitHub automatically—without undoing Loveable’s structure.

## 🔁 Step 6: Create and Merge Your Pull Request

When Codex wraps a task, jump into GitHub. You’ll see a pull request waiting for review. Inspect the diff, request tweaks if needed, then merge.

Because the repo stays synced with Loveable, those merged changes flow back into the builder shortly after.

## ✅ Step 7: Verify in Loveable

Return to your Loveable project and refresh. Your update (like that new blue primary color) should appear. If it doesn’t show immediately, give it a moment or refresh—Loveable sometimes caches versions before syncing the latest commit.

## 💡 Why Combine Loveable and Codex?

Loveable.dev excels at rapid prototyping and visual collaboration. But as projects scale, we consistently see teams hit limits:

- **Hidden code:** Key files stay inaccessible inside the builder.
- **AI drift:** Loveable can overwrite or hallucinate components unexpectedly.
- **No version control:** Collaboration gets risky without branches and reviews.

Codex solves the gap by layering GitHub-native editing, diffing, and agent-powered refactors on top of the Loveable output. You keep shipping fast while gaining the safety net of real version control.

## 🧩 How Prism Uses This Stack

At Prism we run dozens of client sites through this exact workflow across dental, consulting, and hospitality brands.

- **Loveable.dev** handles first drafts, visual approvals, and quick copy tweaks with clients.
- **OpenAI Codex** delivers advanced SEO, performance tuning, bespoke integrations, and code-level polish.

That division of labor lets us move faster without sacrificing technical quality.

## 🛠️ Common Loveable Pitfalls (and How to Avoid Them)

Over the past year we’ve seen recurring issues when teams stay purely inside Loveable:

- AI hallucinations that delete or rewrite key sections.
- Limited control over bug fixes or custom features.
- A closed ecosystem that slows collaboration.

Connecting to Codex gives you an escape hatch—you can patch, extend, and optimize without abandoning Loveable’s speed.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

If you’re building on Loveable.dev, adding Codex is one of the smartest upgrades you can make. You’ll be able to:

- Edit code safely with GitHub tracking every change.
- Sync updates back to Loveable without manual exports.
- Reduce AI missteps while shipping faster.
