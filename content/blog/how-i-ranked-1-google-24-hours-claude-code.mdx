<p class="text-xl font-bold leading-relaxed mb-6">
  The most profitable businesses aren't sexy. And that's exactly why you should build them.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  Everyone's obsessed with building the next AI wrapper or micro-SaaS. I get it. It's exciting.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  But here's what nobody's talking about: There's a massive opportunity right now to dominate boring local businesses using AI. And I mean <em>massive</em>.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  Last weekend, I spent 4 hours building a website for a diesel truck repair service. Within 24 hours, we were ranking in the top 3 on Google for our target keywords. The phone started ringing off the hook. We made thousands of dollars.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  The mechanic is now fully booked for the next few days.
</p>

<p class="mb-6 font-semibold">
  Here's exactly how I did it – and how you can copy this playbook for any local business.
</p>

<hr class="my-8" />

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">
  Why Boring Businesses Are a Goldmine Right Now
</h2>

<p class="mb-6">
  My friend runs a small trucking company. His trucks kept breaking down, so he partnered with a local mechanic. They wanted to start a mobile diesel repair service but had no idea how to market it.
</p>

<p class="mb-6 font-semibold">
  That's when it hit me: The competition in local markets is laughably bad.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  Most local businesses are running websites from 2010. They're using spreadsheets instead of systems. They have zero SEO strategy.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  Meanwhile, you can use Claude Code to build something that blows them out of the water in a single weekend.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  Think about it: When a trucker breaks down on I-77, he's not opening ChatGPT to philosophize about truck repair. He's Googling "mobile diesel mechanic near me" and calling the first result.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  That's real money. Real customers. Real problems that need solving.
</p>

<hr class="my-8" />

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">
  The 4-Hour Website That Changed Everything
</h2>

<p class="mb-6">
  Here's the step-by-step process I used. Don't overthink this – it's simpler than you think.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
  Step 1: Find Your Keywords (5 Minutes)
</h3>

<p class="mb-6">
  Forget expensive SEO tools. Here's all you need to do:
</p>

<ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
  <li>Open ChatGPT or Claude</li>
  <li>Type: "Here's my website [paste URL]. Give me 25-50 keywords I should target for local SEO"</li>
  <li>Done</li>
</ol>

<p class="mb-6">
  The AI will categorize them for you:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
  <li><strong>Emergency keywords</strong> (mobile diesel repair NOW)</li>
  <li><strong>Service keywords</strong> (truck oil change Charlotte)</li>
  <li><strong>Problem keywords</strong> (semi truck won't start)</li>
  <li><strong>Local keywords</strong> (diesel mechanic I-77)</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-6">
  Focus on high-intent keywords – the ones where someone's ready to whip out their credit card.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
  Step 2: Let Claude Code Do an SEO Audit
</h3>

<p class="mb-6">
  This is where it gets wild. I told Claude Code:
</p>

<blockquote class="border-l-4 border-indigo-500 pl-4 my-6 italic">
  "Go through this website in extreme detail. Ultra-think about this. Find all the technical and on-page SEO issues and opportunities we can fix together so I can dominate the local market."
</blockquote>

<p class="mb-6">
  Claude found:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
  <li>Missing robots.txt file</li>
  <li>No XML sitemap</li>
  <li>Slow loading images</li>
  <li>Missing schema markup</li>
  <li>No meta descriptions</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-6 font-semibold">
  Then I said two magic words: "Fix them."
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  That's it. What would take an SEO agency weeks (and thousands of dollars) took Claude about 10 minutes.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
  Step 3: Create Hyper-Local Content
</h3>

<p class="mb-6">
  Here's the secret sauce: Don't just create a generic "Services in Charlotte" page.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  I had Claude create individual pages for each location with:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
  <li>Local landmarks</li>
  <li>Common truck issues in that area</li>
  <li>Local shipping routes</li>
  <li>Even referenced NASCAR (Charlotte thing)</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-6">
  We created 50+ pages. Each one targeting a specific keyword + location combo.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  The competition? They have one generic "Service Areas" page listing 20 cities. Game over.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
  Step 4: Speed Optimization
</h3>

<p class="mb-6">
  Mobile speed matters. Especially when truckers are on the side of the highway with spotty service.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  Claude Code:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
  <li>Compressed all images</li>
  <li>Converted everything to WebP format</li>
  <li>Minified the code</li>
  <li>Made the site load in under 2 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-6 font-semibold">
  Pro tip: Use Google PageSpeed Insights. Copy-paste any errors directly to Claude Code. It'll fix them automatically.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
  Step 5: Launch Multiple Sub-Agents
</h3>

<p class="mb-6">
  This blew my mind. You can tell Claude Code to spin up multiple agents working in parallel:
</p>

<blockquote class="border-l-4 border-indigo-500 pl-4 my-6 italic">
  "Launch 3 agents: One to find content opportunities, one to analyze competitors, one to fix technical issues"
</blockquote>

<p class="mb-6">
  While I worked on the main site, Claude had three other agents running in the background finding opportunities.
</p>

<hr class="my-8" />

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">
  The Results Are Insane
</h2>

<p class="mb-6">
  Within 24 hours:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
  <li>Ranking #1-3 for "mobile diesel mechanic Charlotte"</li>
  <li>Ranking top 3 for "I-77 mobile diesel repair"</li>
  <li>Phone ringing constantly</li>
  <li>Thousands in revenue</li>
  <li>Mechanic fully booked</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-6 font-semibold">
  We're outranking companies that have been around for 20 years.
</p>

<hr class="my-8" />

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">
  The Tech Stack (For Non-Technical People)
</h2>

<p class="mb-6">
  You don't need to be technical. Here's the exact setup:
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  <strong>Design:</strong>
</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
  <li>Get a designer to create something in Figma (worth the investment)</li>
  <li>Use Anima plugin to convert Figma → React components</li>
  <li>Claude Code assembles everything</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-6">
  <strong>Development:</strong>
</p>

<ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
  <li>Install Claude Code (Google "Claude Code install" - it's one terminal command)</li>
  <li>Set up GitHub (free - stores your code)</li>
  <li>Deploy on Vercel (free - makes your site live)</li>
</ol>

<p class="mb-6">
  That's it. Three tools. All either free or $20/month.
</p>

<hr class="my-8" />

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">
  Why This Works (And Will Keep Working)
</h2>

<p class="mb-6">
  "But James, won't AI kill SEO?"
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  No. Here's why:
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  When someone needs their AC fixed, their truck repaired, or their roof replaced, they're not having philosophical conversations with ChatGPT. They're Googling, finding reviews, and calling someone.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  Even when AI search takes over, guess what? The LLMs pull their answers from... websites with good SEO.
</p>

<p class="mb-6 font-semibold">
  Good SEO today = showing up in AI search tomorrow.
</p>

<hr class="my-8" />

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">
  The Multi-Billion Dollar Opportunity
</h2>

<p class="mb-6">
  There are 33 million small businesses in the US. Most have terrible websites. Most have zero SEO strategy.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  Pick literally any boring local business:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
  <li>Plumbers</li>
  <li>Roofers</li>
  <li>Auto repair</li>
  <li>Landscaping</li>
  <li>Pest control</li>
  <li>Pool cleaning</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-6">
  Find someone who knows the business. You handle the tech/marketing. Split the profits.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  You could build 10 of these businesses in the next year. Each one could generate $10-50k/month.
</p>

<p class="mb-6 font-semibold">
  Do the math.
</p>

<hr class="my-8" />

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">
  Your Action Plan
</h2>

<ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-6 space-y-3">
  <li><strong>Find a boring business partner</strong> - Someone who knows the trade but sucks at marketing</li>
  <li><strong>Spend one weekend building</strong> - 4 hours with Claude Code is all you need</li>
  <li><strong>Focus on local SEO</strong> - The competition is weak, the opportunity is massive</li>
  <li><strong>Get the phone ringing</strong> - Real customers, real money, real fast</li>
</ol>

<p class="mb-6 font-semibold">
  Stop chasing the next sexy AI startup. Start dominating boring local markets.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  The arbitrage opportunity is sitting right in front of you.
