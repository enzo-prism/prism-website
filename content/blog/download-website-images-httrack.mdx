## 🪶 introduction

ever spot a beautifully designed website and wish you could keep every image for inspiration, analysis, or reference later? manually saving them one by one is slow and easy to mess up. the smarter move is httrack: a free website copier that mirrors a site locally and keeps the original folder structure intact.

in this walkthrough, you will learn how we install httrack, craft the right filters to grab only images, and keep everything clean for future work.

## 🧠 what is httrack?

httrack crawls a live site, follows its links, and saves the assets it finds. unlike a basic wget command, it understands deeper structures and dynamic image paths, so you get a faithful copy of the media library alongside the html, css, and javascript.

think of it as wget on steroids: smarter defaults, broader compatibility, and plenty of flags to control the download.

## 🎯 when you would use httrack

- 🧩 creative research: archive great design work to study layouts, visuals, and conversion funnels.
- 📦 asset backup: pull media before a redesign or domain switch so nothing gets lost.
- ⚙️ competitive analysis: review a competitor’s brand tone, photography, or packaging in one place.
- 🧠 offline learning: browse a live experience without needing wi-fi.

> ⚠️ only download assets you own or have permission to analyze. httrack is a research and backup tool, not a way to redistribute paid media.

## 🧰 install httrack on macos

```bash
brew install httrack
```

need homebrew first?

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

once that finishes, httrack is ready to use.

## 🪜 download every image with httrack

example target: [Holistic Founder](https://www.holisticfounder.com/)

want the full local rebuild workflow after mirroring? see our [codex rebuild guide](/openai/site-rebuild).

```bash
# 1. create a folder for the download
mkdir ~/Desktop/holisticfounder-images

# 2. move into that folder
cd ~/Desktop/holisticfounder-images

# 3. mirror the site and keep only images
httrack https://www.holisticfounder.com/ -O ./ -%v "+*.jpg" "+*.jpeg" "+*.png" "+*.webp" "+*.gif" "+*.svg" "-ad.doubleclick.net/*"
```

### 🧩 command breakdown

| flag | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `-O ./` | saves the mirrored site to the current folder |
| `-%v` | enables verbose output so you can watch progress |
| `"+*.jpg" "+*.png" ...` | includes specific image extensions |
| `"-ad.doubleclick.net/*"` | skips ad and tracking links |
| `https://...` | the starting url httrack will crawl |

after the crawl completes you will have a folder full of images, organized by the original path structure.

confirm the download worked:

```bash
find . -type f \( -iname "*.jpg" -o -iname "*.jpeg" -o -iname "*.png" -o -iname "*.webp" -o -iname "*.gif" -o -iname "*.svg" \) | wc -l
```

## 🧹 optional: flatten the folder

prefer a single directory with every image? run:

```bash
find . -type f \( -iname "*.jpg" -o -iname "*.jpeg" -o -iname "*.png" -o -iname "*.webp" -o -iname "*.gif" -o -iname "*.svg" \) -exec mv {} ~/Desktop/holisticfounder-images/ \;
```

that moves every image into one top-level folder for quick browsing.

## 🧭 pro tips

- control crawl depth: `httrack https://example.com -O ./my-site -r3`
- speed it up on large sites: add `--sockets=4`
- skip massive e-commerce catalogs unless you truly need every asset

## ⚙️ alternatives

- `wget` — ideal for static sites with straightforward assets.
- SiteSucker — app store gui if you prefer clicks over terminal flags.
- browser devtools network tab — quick grab for a handful of images.

httrack remains the most flexible approach when you need structure, filters, and reliable results.

## 💡 conclusion

keeping a local image archive accelerates redesigns, brand audits, and inspiration boards. at prism we use this httrack workflow whenever we onboard a client or map competitor ecosystems — it turns hours of manual downloading into minutes.
