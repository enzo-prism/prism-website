## Why I’m Writing This

At Prism, we build websites that don’t just look great — they help businesses grow. That means we’re constantly testing the latest AI-powered tools to figure out what really works and what’s just hype.

Recently, Lovable launched their cloud backend update and opened up a free trial week. It looked promising, so I put it to the test on real client projects. Here’s what I found.

---

## The Promise of Lovable

Lovable markets itself as magical:

- Type in plain text instructions.
- Watch it build a functional website or app.
- Iterate quickly without needing deep coding expertise.

For business owners, that sounds like a dream. In theory, it means less reliance on developers and faster time to market.

---

## The Reality Check

In practice, Lovable is still far from dependable for business-critical projects. A few examples from my testing:

- **Image uploads that break:** Adding a simple screenshot to a client’s blog turned into hours of back-and-forth with the AI. Only after renaming the file and disabling “plan mode” did it finally work.
- **Recipes deleted by mistake:** A client wanted new recipes added to their site. Instead, Lovable deleted all the existing ones.
- **Ripple-effect bugs:** Changing a button style on one page unexpectedly broke other designs across the site.

These are small tasks that should be easy. Instead, they became roadblocks.

---

## Comparisons: Replit, Cursor, Vercel

When we use Replit, Cursor, or Vercel’s v0, these kinds of issues rarely happen. In fact:

- Replit is currently the most reliable for shipping websites that just work.
- Cursor (running GPT-5 Codex) feels much more consistent at understanding context.
- Vercel’s v0 is excellent for design-driven projects.

Lovable still feels like “one step forward, two steps back.”

---

## Why This Matters for Businesses

For an agency like Prism, these issues go beyond technical frustration. When a client’s recipes disappear or a blog image won’t load, it damages trust. Business owners need tools that are consistent — not experimental.

That’s why we carefully choose the right platform for each project. Our job is to make sure nothing falls through the cracks, so you can focus on running your business.

---

## The Future of Lovable

To be fair, Lovable is innovating quickly. Their cloud update is a step in the right direction, and the tool has huge potential. In a few months, it might truly live up to the hype.

But today? It’s not ready to be the foundation for a client-facing website.

---

## Prism’s Takeaway

- Lovable = promising but unstable. Great for experimentation, not production.
- Replit, Cursor, Vercel = client-ready. These are the tools we trust right now.
- Our role at Prism: Cut through the hype, test in the trenches, and make sure your business gets a website that works — consistently.

---

## Final Thoughts

If you’re curious, I still recommend trying Lovable during their free week. Experiment, build something small, and see what you think.

But if you’re running a business where every lead counts, Prism will guide you toward the tools that deliver results today — while keeping an eye on the innovations that may shape tomorrow.
