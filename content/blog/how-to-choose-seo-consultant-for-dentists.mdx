**TL;DR:** pick a consultant who understands **local + dental intent**, can translate strategy into a **real implementation backlog**, and reports against **calls + forms**, not vanity metrics. if you want to see what that looks like, start with our{" "}

## why dentist seo consulting is different

dentistry is high-trust and hyperlocal. you’re not just trying to “rank for seo”—you’re trying to show up when someone searches:

- “dentist near me” (maps + organic)
- “emergency dentist”
- “invisalign”
- “dental implants consultation”

that means your seo consultant needs to understand:

- **google maps** and your google business profile
- **service-line intent** (treatments)
- **location intent** (cities, neighborhoods, multi-location groups)
- **trust signals** (reviews, citations, consistency, proof)

## the checklist: how to vet an seo consultant for dentists

### 1) confirm they understand dental + local intent

ask them to walk through how they’d approach *your* top services. a good answer sounds like: “treatments + locations + conversion flow.”

red flags:

- they only talk about “blogging more”
- they only talk about backlinks
- they can’t explain how maps and organic support each other

### 2) require an intent-mapped page plan (not doorway pages)

you want a clear page map for:

- high-value treatments (implants, invisalign, emergency, etc.)
- locations (if relevant)
- providers (when it helps trust)
- insurance / financing FAQs (when appropriate)

if their plan is “publish 200 pages and see what sticks,” you’ll usually get thin content that doesn’t convert.

### 3) ask about google business profile + listings

the fastest path to better visibility is often tightening your listings system:

- categories and services
- attributes and descriptions
- photos
- posts + q&a
- review capture workflow

if they ignore listings, they’re ignoring a major lever. (prism’s approach: <a href="/local-listings" class="underline underline-offset-4">local listing optimization</a>)

### 4) validate technical fundamentals

dental seo gets stuck when the site is hard to crawl and hard to understand. ask how they handle:

- indexation (what should/shouldn’t be indexed)
- canonical hygiene
- internal linking structure
- schema and structured data
- performance (core web vitals)

prism’s breakdown of the on-page side: <a href="/seo/on-page" class="underline underline-offset-4">on-page seo</a>.

### 5) evaluate their content approach

you’re not paying for “more words.” you’re paying for:

- clear service explanations that reduce patient anxiety
- expectations around pricing/insurance/financing
- FAQs that match real questions patients ask
- the right next step (call, form, book)

if you want the off-site proof systems too: <a href="/seo/off-page" class="underline underline-offset-4">off-page seo</a>.

### 6) demand reporting tied to outcomes

“rankings went up” isn’t enough. good reporting connects the work to:

- calls
- form submissions
- booked demand (when tracking allows)

ask what they’ll do if rankings improve but calls don’t. the answer should include conversion changes, intent changes, and better treatment alignment—not excuses.

### 7) agree on cadence and who executes

clarify the engagement model:

- consulting-only (your team executes)
- consultant-led (hybrid)
- done-for-you delivery

then define deliverables:

- what ships weekly
- what changes monthly
- what you’ll measure

## questions to ask on the first call

- “what would you do in the first 30 days?”
- “which treatments should we prioritize first, and why?”
- “how do you handle maps visibility and listings?”
- “how do you avoid thin or doorway content?”
- “what does reporting look like, and what outcomes do you track?”
