  Most teams overcomplicate growth. In the GPT-5 era, the constraint isn’t
  <em>what’s possible</em>—it’s the loop speed between idea and result.
  Give readers a quick hook, then immediately offer the video. That keeps the loop tight on mobile (still above the fold) and doesn’t interrupt the section flow.
  By Prism — beautiful work. measurable growth.

There are only two levers that matter now:

1. Infinite creativity on demand.
2. Execution at near-instant speed.

## The loop that compounds

The magic is compressing the cycle time between idea and iteration. If you shorten the time to your next signal, you outlearn the market. GPT-5 turns that into a daily habit: ideate → ship → measure → improve.

## How we run it

- Identify a needle-mover worth testing.
- Generate multiple creative variations in minutes.
- Ship the simplest viable version today.
- Instrument with lightweight metrics.
- Use the data to improve the next pass.

## Where teams get stuck

- Overproduction before proof.
- Blocking on “perfect” assets or copy.
- Not instrumenting the outcome.

Ship smaller, more often—and keep the loop tight.
