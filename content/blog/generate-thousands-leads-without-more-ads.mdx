<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
  <em>Most businesses lose 90% of their website visitors because they ask for the sale before they earn trust. Here’s how to fix it with a lead magnet system inspired by Alex Hormozi’s $100M Leads framework.</em>
</p>

If cold traffic bounces the second it lands on your site, you have a follow-up problem—not a traffic problem. A small, self-contained “lead magnet” captures contact info, delivers quick value, and gives you permission to keep the conversation going without touching ad spend.

---

## the core idea: offer value before you pitch

Lead magnets flip the traditional funnel:

1. **Capture** name, email, and phone early—before visitors disappear.
2. **Deliver** something useful instantly so your brand earns trust.
3. **Convert** later with tailored offers once they’ve experienced value.

Done right, this shift alone can 3–5× conversions on the traffic you already have.

---

## step 1 — pick your lead magnet type

Hormozi highlights three reliable formats that work for local, service, and digital businesses:

### 1. reveal a problem

Help prospects see what’s broken (and what it costs them) so inaction feels risky.

- Free website speed or conversion test  
- Posture analysis at a chiropractic office  
- Mini ad account audit that exposes wasted spend

### 2. free trial

Let people experience the outcome before they buy.

- “Free whitening session” for dental practices  
- “First class free” for a pilates studio  
- “7-day access” to a micro-saas product

### 3. one step of many

Solve a single stage inside a larger transformation, then guide them to the full service.

- Color palette guide from a stylist  
- First laser hair removal session (needs 6–8 total)  
- SEO checklist that leads into managed SEO

Pick the format that aligns with how you normally deliver value. High-consideration services do best with problem-reveal offers; habit-forming products benefit from trials; complex services love “one of many” deliverables.

---

## step 2 — choose how to deliver it

There are four common delivery methods (mix and match as needed):

- **Software / tools** — calculators, graders, or interactive audits (ex. “Google Ads ROI checker”)
- **Information** — mini courses, templates, swipe files (ex. “Dental implant ad blueprint”)
- **Services** — quick done-for-you samples (ex. “Free homepage speed fix in 24 hours”)
- **Physical products** — branded kits with qualification (ex. “Free CEO shirt for verified business owners”)

Whatever you choose, make the delivery instant, clear, and tied to the problem you solve.

---

## step 3 — name it like an offer, not a pdf

The name is the hook. Use promise-driven formulas:

- **Number + outcome + timeframe**  
  “3 emails that turn cold leads into clients in 24 hours.”

- **How to [result] without [pain]**  
  “How to get 30 new patients a month without running ads.”

- **Adjective + type + benefit**  
  “The lazy dentist’s lead generator.”

- **X mistakes keeping you from [result]**  
  “5 website mistakes costing you new patients every week.”

Test names via polls, Stories, email subject lines—ship the version that wins the most clicks before you build the asset.

---

## step 4 — include the cta every time

Deliver the magnet, then immediately show the next action:

1. **Clarity** — “Book your 15‑minute roadmap call.”
2. **Action** — one button, one outcome.
3. **Reason to act now** — real scarcity like limited audits or onboarding slots.

Example:

> “Claim your free audit before Friday—we’re only taking five this week.”

Ask confidently. You earned attention; now direct it.

---

## step 5 — test, refine, repeat

- If conversions are low, swap the **headline before** rebuilding the asset.  
- If leads are unqualified, add a **filter question** (budget, timeline, role).  
- If it’s taking too long, ship the **simpler version** and iterate live.

Treat the magnet like an ad: run variations until one consistently attracts ideal buyers.

---

## key takeaway

Lead magnets work because they move you from “buy from me” to “let me help you first.” Offer-driven funnels build trust, capture attention, and create a pipeline you can nurture—without raising media spend.
