How We Supercharged Prism’s Site with Midjourney Video (and How You Can, Too)

Stunning motion doesn’t have to drain your budget—if you know the right AI tools.

⸻

TL;DR
•Midjourney’s new video model lets small teams create studio-grade motion graphics for $10 / month.
•Start with a static Midjourney image, then “Animate → High Motion” (or Low) to generate 4 video variants.
•Use a divergent → convergent workflow: explore broadly, then refine a single hero asset.
•Embed carefully: optimize file size, lazy-load, and test Core Web Vitals so motion boosts delight without tanking performance.
•Scroll to the bottom for the full tutorial video.

Why Motion Matters

A scroll-stopping hero section or subtle looped background instantly communicates that your brand sweats the details. Until recently, that polish meant:
1.Hiring a motion studio (⟩$5k per clip)
2.Slow revision cycles
3.Risky scope creep

AI-driven generation flips that script. We now prototype, iterate, and ship micro-animations in hours, not weeks—freeing budget for growth experiments elsewhere.

Midjourney Video in a Nutshell

FeatureOld WorkflowMidjourney Video Workflow
Asset CreationDesign → Storyboard → AnimatePrompt a single image
Variation / IdeationManual mood boards, versioning“Animate” → auto-diverges to 4 clips
Cost & TurnaroundHigh, slow$10 / mo, ~1 min per clip

How it works:
1.Prompt a static image (e.g., “Howl’s Moving Castle-inspired watercolor cityscape, dusk, warm light”).
2.Choose your favorite of the four divergent results.
3.Click Animate → High Motion or Low Motion.
4.Download the 4-second MP4 / WebM loop.

Midjourney’s UX mirrors best-practice design thinking: diverge widely, converge decisively.

Case Study: Prism’s Revamped Hero

<img src="(screenshot placeholder)" alt="Prism hero section with Midjourney video background" width="100%">


Old look: static gradient, generic stock image.
New look: a gently parallaxing AI video loop that hints at creativity and technical mastery.

Impact so far
•+18 % average time-on-page (Hotjar, first 14 days)
•Client demos consistently start with “How did you make that header?!”

⸻

Our Step-by-Step Workflow
1.Seed Inspiration
•Favorite reference frame → drag into Midjourney (Image Prompt).
2.Iterate Prompts
•“Add studio ghibli vibes” → Version 4 nailed our brand feel.
3.Animate
•High-Motion for the hero (bolder), Low-Motion for secondary sections (subtle).
4.Compression
•FFMPEG: ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 900k output.webm
•Target ≤1 MB for above-the-fold assets.
5.Embed

       src="/assets/prism-hero.webm"
       style="width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;"></video>


6.Performance Checks
•Lighthouse score ≥90 on mobile after lazy-loading off-screen videos.
7.Accessibility / SEO
•Provide alt fallback and poster frame; ensure text contrast over motion.

Practical Tips

DoDon’t
Batch-generate 3–5 prompts, then A/B test.Set every section to High-Motion—visual fatigue is real.
Encode to WebM and MP4 for widest support.Autoplay with sound (kills engagement).
Archive prompts & seeds in Notion; reproducibility matters.Ignore Core Web Vitals—Google will.

What’s Next?

This post just scratches the surface. In future deep-dives we’ll cover:
1.Dynamic prompt chaining (programmatic generation from CMS data).
2.AI-driven video sprites for in-app micro-interactions.
3.Performance budgeting for motion-heavy landing pages.
