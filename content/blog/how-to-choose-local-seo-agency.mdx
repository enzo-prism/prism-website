when someone searches “local seo agency”, they’re usually past the learning stage. they’re comparing partners and trying to avoid wasting six months on vague reports and no real movement.

this checklist is designed to help you choose an agency that aligns with how google actually works — and avoids the tactics that create short-term spikes and long-term risk.

## a quick refresher: how local rankings work

google’s local results are mainly based on **relevance**, **distance**, and **prominence**. the right agency should be able to explain these clearly and map their work to each one.

- **relevance**: does your business and your pages match what the searcher wants?
- **distance (proximity)**: are you eligible for the searcher’s location or implied location?
- **prominence**: do you look trusted and well-known across the web?

## 1) clarify the outcome (before you talk to agencies)

local seo can’t be measured only by a keyword list. decide what matters:

- calls from google business profile
- direction requests and map views
- booked appointments (forms + scheduling)
- store visits and repeat customers

if an agency can’t translate “rank higher” into specific customer actions, you’ll end up with a report that looks good and a business that doesn’t.

## 2) ask: “how will you improve relevance, distance, and prominence?”

good answers sound like systems, not hacks.

### relevance questions

- how will you align our categories, services, and on-page content with real search intent?
- what pages will you create or improve (service pages, location pages, faq pages)?
- how will you prevent cannibalization (multiple pages competing for the same query)?

### distance questions

- do you understand our business model (storefront vs service-area business)?
- how will you configure service areas and location signals correctly?

### prominence questions

- what is your review strategy (volume + recency + responses)?
- how will you approach citations and mentions?
- do you earn links and local coverage through real partnerships — or sell link packages?

## 3) inspect how they create pages and content

there’s a difference between “publishing content” and “publishing helpful content.”

google explicitly emphasizes **helpful, reliable, people-first content** and warns against pages created primarily to attract search visits rather than help users.

### what to look for

- pages that answer real questions clearly (not fluff)
- content that matches your actual services and locations
- proof on the page: photos, examples, specifics
- internal links that guide users to the next step (call, book, learn)

### what to avoid (doorway patterns)

google’s spam policies call out doorway abuse and keyword stuffing — both are common in low-quality “local seo agency” offers.

## 4) demand proof you can validate

ask for evidence you can check, not stories.

- case studies with before/after screenshots (maps visibility, calls, leads)
- references you can contact
- examples of pages they shipped (not just “audits”)
- reviews that look real and are spread across platforms

if everything is “confidential” and “we can’t share anything”, treat that as a signal — not a constraint.

## 5) require reporting tied to customer actions (not vanity rankings)

rankings matter, but they’re not the product. the product is customers.

at minimum, your reporting should include:

- google business profile: calls, website clicks, direction requests
- website: form submissions, calls, bookings, and top landing pages
- visibility: a small set of tracked queries that map to revenue

google also notes that it primarily uses page content to generate snippets, so vague pages and vague reporting often go together.

## 6) red flags that should make you walk away

- “we guarantee #1 in 30 days”
- “we have a secret method”
- “we’ll add your keyword to your google business profile name”
- “we build 100 city pages per month”
- “we sell you a backlink package”
- reports that only show keyword position and nothing about leads or calls

if you want to stay on google’s good side, you want a partner that is allergic to spam tactics.

## a simple scorecard you can use

when evaluating a local seo agency, score each category 0–2:

1. clarity: do they explain the plan in plain english?
2. execution: do they ship real changes or just audits?
3. proof: can you verify results and references?
4. measurement: do they track calls, leads, and map actions?
5. integrity: do they avoid doorway pages, fake reviews, and link schemes?
