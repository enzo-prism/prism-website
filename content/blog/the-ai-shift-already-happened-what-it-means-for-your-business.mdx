## You're in the "This Seems Overblown" Phase

Think back to February 2020. Most of us were going about our normal routines while a handful of people were quietly preparing for something big. Within three weeks, the entire world changed.

I think we're in the same early phase right now, except with AI. And this time, the transformation won't last a few years and then snap back. This one is permanent.

I spend every day building with AI tools for our clients at Prism. I'm not making predictions about a distant future. I'm telling you what already changed in my own work, and warning you that the same shift is coming to your business, your industry, and your competitors.

## What Actually Happened on February 5th

Two major AI labs released new models on the same day: OpenAI dropped GPT-5.3 Codex and Anthropic released Opus 4.6. Something fundamentally shifted.

Here's what my week looks like now: I describe what I want built in plain English, walk away from my computer, and come back hours later to find the work done. Not a rough draft I need to fix. The finished product. The AI writes the code, opens the app, clicks through the buttons, tests the features, finds problems, fixes them on its own, and only comes back to me when it's satisfied with the result.

A year ago I was going back and forth with AI constantly, guiding it, making corrections. Now I describe the outcome and leave.

That's not a small improvement. That's a different world.

## Why This Matters Even if You're Not in Tech

The AI companies made a deliberate strategic decision: make AI great at writing code first. Why? Because building better AI requires code. If AI writes that code, it helps build the next version of itself. A smarter version that writes better code, which builds an even smarter version.

They've now done it. And they're moving on to everything else.

The experience tech workers have had over the past year, watching AI go from "helpful tool" to "does my job better than I do," is the experience every other industry is about to have. Law, finance, medicine, accounting, consulting, marketing, customer service. The people building these systems say one to five years. Some say less. Given what I've seen in just the last couple of months, "less" seems more likely.

## "I Tried ChatGPT and It Wasn't That Great"

I hear this constantly from business owners. And I get it. If you tried it in 2023 or early 2024, you were right. It made stuff up. It felt like a novelty.

That was two years ago. In AI terms, that's ancient history.

The models available today are unrecognizable from what existed six months ago. The debate about whether AI is "hitting a wall" is over. Anyone still making that argument either hasn't used the current models or is judging based on an experience that's no longer relevant.

Here's a key thing most people don't realize: the free version of these tools is over a year behind what paying users have access to. Judging AI by free-tier ChatGPT is like judging smartphones by using a flip phone. For $20 a month, you get access to tools that are genuinely transforming how the most forward-thinking businesses operate.

## What the Smart Operators Are Doing Right Now

I've talked to managing partners at major law firms who spend hours every day using AI. Not because it's a toy. Because it works. One told me it's like having a team of associates available instantly. He said every couple of months, it gets significantly more capable for his work. He expects it'll be able to do most of what he does before long, and he's someone with decades of experience.

The people who are ahead in their industries aren't dismissing this. They're blown away by what it can already do.

Here's what those early movers have in common:

They're using the paid tier with the best available model, not the default. They're pushing AI into their actual workflow, not just asking it quick questions like a search engine. They're feeding it real documents, real data, real business problems. And they're iterating, refining their prompts, giving more context, trying again when the first attempt isn't perfect.

The person who walks into a meeting and says "I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days" is the most valuable person in the room right now. That window won't stay open long.

## What This Means for Small and Mid-Sized Businesses

Here's where I want to speak directly to the business owners reading this, because this is actually where the opportunity is biggest.

Large enterprises move slowly. They have committees, compliance reviews, IT departments that need to approve every new tool. A Fortune 500 company might take 18 months to roll out an AI initiative.

You can start tomorrow.

That speed advantage is real and it's enormous. Here's how to use it:

**Your marketing.** AI can now write genuinely good copy for your website, your ads, your email campaigns, your social posts. Not generic filler. Quality content tailored to your specific business, your specific customers, your specific voice. What used to take a copywriter days can happen in an afternoon. This doesn't mean you fire your marketing team. It means your marketing team can now do 5x the output, test more ideas, and move faster than competitors who are still doing everything the old way.

**Your customer communications.** Proposals, follow-up emails, client reports, FAQ responses: all of this can be drafted by AI in minutes rather than hours. The businesses that respond faster, communicate more clearly, and follow up more consistently will win. AI makes all three dramatically easier.

**Your operations.** Analyzing your books, summarizing contracts before you sign them, creating SOPs for your team, drafting job descriptions, building training materials. These tasks used to eat entire days. They don't have to anymore.

**Your web presence.** This is what we do at Prism, and I can tell you firsthand: the gap between businesses with AI-optimized web presences and those without is widening fast. AI search (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity) is changing how customers find businesses. If your website isn't structured for both traditional and AI-powered search, you're becoming invisible to a growing segment of your potential customers.

## The Pace Is the Part That's Hardest to Believe

Let me make it concrete:

In 2022, AI couldn't reliably do basic math.

By 2023, it could pass the bar exam.

By 2024, it could write working software and explain graduate-level science.

By late 2025, top engineers were handing over most of their coding work to AI.

On February 5, 2026, new models arrived that made everything before them feel like a different era.

There's an organization called METR that measures how long of a task AI can complete without human help. A year ago, the answer was about ten minutes. Then an hour. Then several hours. The most recent measurement showed AI completing tasks that take a human expert nearly five hours, and that capability is doubling roughly every four to seven months.

Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic (who makes Claude), has said that AI models "substantially smarter than almost all humans at almost all tasks" are on track for 2026 or 2027. If that's even close to true, the business landscape is going to look very different very soon.

## What You Should Do This Week

I'm not writing this to scare you. I'm writing this because the single biggest advantage you can have right now is being early.

**1. Start using AI for real work, today.** Sign up for the paid version of Claude or ChatGPT ($20/month). Make sure you select the best model available, not the default. Right now that's Claude Opus 4.6 or GPT-5.2. Give it a real business task: draft a proposal, analyze a spreadsheet, rewrite your homepage copy, create a customer onboarding email sequence. Don't ask it trivia questions. Push it into the work you actually do.

**2. Spend one hour a day experimenting.** Every day, try to get it to do something new. Something you haven't tried before, something you're not sure it can handle. If you do this for the next three months, you will understand what's coming better than 95% of your competitors. The bar is still on the floor.

**3. Audit your web presence for the AI search era.** How does your business show up when someone asks ChatGPT or Gemini for a recommendation in your category? If the answer is "it doesn't," that's a problem that's getting bigger every month. This is something we help clients with every day at Prism, making sure your business is visible not just in Google, but in AI-powered search too.

**4. Think about your competitive moat.** The things that will be hardest for AI to replace aren't technical skills. They're relationships, trust, local reputation, physical presence, and the taste and judgment that come from deeply understanding your specific customers. Double down on those while using AI to handle everything else faster.

**5. Don't wait for perfect. Start messy.** The first time you use AI for a real task, it might not be perfect. That's fine. The point is to start building the muscle now, while most of your competitors are still dismissing it as a fad.

## The Opportunity Is Massive, if You Move Now

Here's the part that doesn't get said enough: this is one of the best moments in history to be a small business owner who's willing to learn.

Knowledge that used to require expensive consultants is now available for $20 a month. Marketing that used to require a full team can now be executed by a founder with AI. Websites that used to take months and tens of thousands of dollars can be built in days. The barriers that kept small businesses from competing with bigger players are falling fast.

The businesses that will thrive aren't the biggest or the most well-funded. They're the ones that adapt fastest. And right now, the fastest adapters are small, nimble operators who are willing to experiment.

The future didn't send a save-the-date. It's already here. The only question is whether you'll be ready when your customers, and your competitors, figure that out too.
