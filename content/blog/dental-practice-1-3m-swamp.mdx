<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
The hardest part about scaling isn't finding opportunities —<br />
It's affording the people who can execute them.
</p>

<p>
Say your cosmetic or ortho practice is doing <strong>$1.8M a year</strong>.<br />
At 35–40% margins, that's <strong>$630K–$720K profit</strong>.
</p>

<div class="my-8 p-6 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-500">
<p class="font-semibold mb-4">Now here's where it gets real:</p>
<ul class="space-y-2">
<li>• To grow, your marketing budget needs to jump to <strong>$8K–$12K/month</strong>.</li>
<li>• Building an in-house marketing team? <strong>$250K–$300K/year</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="text-xl font-medium my-6">
That's easily 40–50% of your profit tied up.
</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">So you end up choosing between:</h3>

<div class="space-y-4 my-6">
<div class="flex items-start">
<span class="text-2xl mr-3">1️⃣</span>
<p class="flex-1">Betting big on full-time hires + higher marketing spend.</p>
</div>
<div class="flex items-start">
<span class="text-2xl mr-3">2️⃣</span>
<p class="flex-1">Running lean, but wearing too many hats yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="flex items-start">
<span class="text-2xl mr-3">3️⃣</span>
<p class="flex-1">Staying stuck at $1.5–2M forever.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="text-lg font-medium my-8">
That's why so many practices stall in this range.
</p>

<div class="mt-12 p-8 bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-indigo-50 dark:from-gray-800 dark:to-gray-900 rounded-xl">
