<p>
The hardest part about scaling isn't finding opportunities —
It's affording the people who can execute them.
</p>

<p>
Say your cosmetic or ortho practice is doing <strong>$1.8M a year</strong>.
At 35–40% margins, that's <strong>$630K–$720K profit</strong>.
</p>

<div class="my-6 p-4 border-t border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
<p class="mb-3">Now here's where it gets real:</p>
<ul class="space-y-1">
<li>• To grow, your marketing budget needs to jump to <strong>$8K–$12K/month</strong>.</li>
<li>• Building an in-house marketing team? <strong>$250K–$300K/year</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="my-6">
That's easily 40–50% of your profit tied up.
</p>

<h3 class="mt-8 mb-4">So you end up choosing between:</h3>

<ol class="space-y-3 my-6">
<li>1. Betting big on full-time hires + higher marketing spend.</li>
<li>2. Running lean, but wearing too many hats yourself.</li>
<li>3. Staying stuck at $1.5–2M forever.</li>
</ol>

<p class="my-8">
That's why so many practices stall in this range.
</p>

<div class="mt-12 pt-8 border-t border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
<h3 class="mb-4">At Prism, we help you get past the swamp—</h3>
