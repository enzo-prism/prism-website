*By Enzo Sison - Founder, Prism*

Hey, I'm Enzo. We build and maintain websites for founders who actually care about growth: more qualified leads, better conversion rates, and higher lifetime value per customer.

In the video below, I walk through a live example using a Beverly Hills dental practice. This post slows it down and shows, step-by-step, how we turn AI + Google Search Console + clean site architecture into a compounding SEO flywheel you can use on any website.

<YouTubeVideoEmbed videoId="huJDr7iw6fw" title="Turning your website into an AI-powered SEO flywheel" className="my-8" />

You can copy a lot of this yourself. If you'd rather have a team run it end-to-end for you, that's what we do at Prism.

## The three metrics that actually matter

Everything we do is aimed at moving three numbers:

1. **Qualified leads** - how many real opportunities hit your inbox or booking funnel.
2. **Conversion rate** - how many of those leads become paying customers.
3. **Lifetime value (LTV)** - how long they stick around and how much they spend over time.

Most "SEO work" gets lost in vanity metrics: traffic, rankings, impressions. We use those, but only as inputs into a system designed to move the three numbers above. That system is the SEO flywheel.

## What I mean by an SEO flywheel

A flywheel is a loop that gets easier to spin the more you spin it.

For SEO, our flywheel looks like this:

1. **Collect real search data** -> from Google Search Console (GSC) and your site.
2. **Let AI do the heavy thinking** -> large models analyze the data, find gaps, and design content and page ideas.
3. **Implement fast** -> we use AI coding agents (like our Codeex workflow) to ship new pages and structures.
4. **Measure again in GSC** -> see what moved, feed fresh data back into the models.
5. **Repeat** -> each cycle compounds what you did last time.

Most founders stop at step 1.5. They glance at GSC, feel overwhelmed, and go back to guessing. Let's walk through the whole loop.

---

## The tool stack we use (and what you can use)

Here's what we use under the hood at Prism:

* **Google Search Console** - the non-negotiable core. It tells you which queries are triggering your site, how often (impressions), how often people click (CTR), and which pages are doing the work.
* **Large language model (LLM)** - we use **GPT-5.1 Pro** heavily because we run big, long-running analysis jobs on it. You don't have to use that exact model; any strong model that can handle long context is fine.
* **ChatGPT Atlas browser** - lets the model see what we see in the browser (GSC dashboards, site code, etc.) so it can reason over real data instead of just what we paste in.
* **Codeex / AI dev stack** - our internal AI-assisted coding workflow for actually changing the website: creating pages, updating sitemaps, adjusting URLs, and integrating analytics.

You can absolutely approximate this with GSC, a solid AI model in any interface, and either your own dev team or a good website builder. The framework matters more than the exact tools.

---

## Step 1: get real data flowing from Google Search Console

If you don't have Search Console set up, do that first. No way around it.

Once it's running and you've got at least a few weeks of data, look at:

* **Total impressions** (how often you showed up)
* **Total clicks**
* **Average CTR**
* **Average position**
* The **Queries** table

In the video example, the dental practice had roughly 14.5k impressions in 28 days, 66 clicks, and a 0.5% CTR. Not amazing, but it's real data, and real data is what we want. Even "bad" data is better than guessing.

---

## Step 2: mine your queries for intent and gaps

This is where AI takes the pain away.

Export the **Queries** table from GSC (or copy it out of the UI if you have to). Then feed it to your model with a prompt along these lines:

```text
You are an SEO strategist.

Here is a Google Search Console export for [BUSINESS NAME].
Each row has: query, impressions, clicks, CTR, average position.

1. Group the queries by intent (informational, commercial, navigational, local, etc.).
2. Identify:
   - which queries are already converting (high CTR, decent position),
   - which queries are sleepers (high impressions, low CTR),
   - which queries show unmet intent (we rank but do not fully answer the question).
3. Propose 10-20 new page or content ideas that would best capture and convert this demand.
4. Prioritize those ideas for business impact, not just traffic volume.
```

For our Beverly Hills client, the model came back with clusters like "veneers Beverly Hills," "cosmetic dentist," and "full mouth reconstruction," plus gaps where people were searching for specific procedures or FAQs that the site barely covered. The AI-generated roadmap included service pages, FAQ pages, location-optimized pages, and educational blog posts.

The important thing: you're no longer staring blindly at a CSV. The AI is summarizing, clustering, and ranking it for you.

---

## Step 3: bring in your sitemap (your site's skeleton)

Queries tell you what people want. Your sitemap tells you how your site is currently structured to answer (or ignore) that demand.

For any site, you can usually hit:

```text
https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml
```

Copy or export that XML, then feed it to the model as a second piece of context:

```text
Here is the current sitemap for the same website.
Each URL represents a page. Use this together with the GSC analysis you just did.

1. Map the existing URLs to the query clusters and page ideas you proposed.
2. Identify:
   - which existing pages should be improved or expanded,
   - which entirely new pages need to be created,
   - which pages are redundant or confusing.
3. For each new page you recommend, suggest:
   - URL slug,
   - page type (service, blog, FAQ, location page, etc.),
   - where it should live in the navigation / site hierarchy,
   - the primary query and supporting queries it should target.
```

Here you're not just adding a blog post. You're re-architecting the site so Google and AI crawlers can instantly understand what you do, who you serve, where you operate, and why you're a good answer for specific search intents. AI does the heavy thinking; you decide what makes business sense.

---

## Step 4: design a publishing cadence (do not dump everything at once)

One thing the model and I both strongly recommend: do not drop 50 new pages in one day.

Better:

* Ship consistently over weeks or months.
* Treat each new page like a small experiment.
* Watch how it performs, then tune the next batch.

Ask the model:

```text
Given this list of recommended pages and our current authority,
design a 12-16 week publishing schedule.

Constraints:
- 1-2 new or significantly revised pages per week.
- Prioritize pages that are closest to purchase intent and most aligned with our core services.
- For each week, list:
  - The page(s) to create/update.
  - The main goal of the page.
  - How we should measure success in Search Console.
```

Now you have a roadmap instead of a random list of ideas.

---

## Step 5: implement fast with AI-assisted development

Ideas do not move metrics. Shipped pages do.

At Prism, this is where our Codeex tooling comes in. We generate initial drafts of each page (copy and structure) with the same model that designed the strategy, then use AI-assisted coding to build or update templates, wire up internal links, adjust URLs and redirects, keep the sitemap and robots directives clean, and handle technical SEO (titles, meta, schema, etc.).

If you're doing this yourself:

* Use AI to draft, but do not paste blindly.
* Make sure every page has one clear primary topic.
* Answer the searcher's real question better than your competitors.
* Add a clear next step (book, call, fill out a form, etc.).
* Connect pages logically with internal links.

Keep a human in the loop for voice, accuracy, regulations, design, and UX.

---

## Step 6: measure, learn, and feed the flywheel

Once new pages are live, give Google some time to crawl and index them. Then head back into Search Console and filter performance by page to see how each new asset is doing. Look again at queries:

* Are you getting impressions for the terms you targeted?
* Did CTR improve?
* Are you seeing new, related queries you did not plan for?

Then you repeat the process:

1. Export fresh data.
2. Ask the model to compare "before vs after."
3. Update the content roadmap and publishing cadence.
4. Implement again.

Every loop makes your site easier for humans to navigate, easier for Google and AI crawlers to understand, and more aligned with real demand. That's the flywheel.

## Common mistakes founders make (and how to avoid them)

Let's be blunt about where this usually goes wrong:

1. **Treating GSC like a dashboard, not a dataset.** People glance at charts and never export the rows. The gold is in the raw queries. Use them.
2. **Publishing content with no architecture.** Random blog posts with weak internal linking do almost nothing. Use sitemaps and URL structures intentionally.
3. **Going all-in on volume keywords.** Chasing massive search volume usually means competing with massive incumbents. Start with high-intent, lower-volume queries that your actual buyers are typing.
4. **Copying competitors instead of out-serving them.** Do not spin slightly different versions of what everyone else already has. Answer the question more clearly, with better examples, visuals, FAQs, and CTAs.
5. **Ignoring technical basics.** Slow site, broken mobile layouts, messy URL parameters, missing HTTPS or redirects. Fix this first; no AI analysis will save a site that loads like it's 2007.

---

## If you want to DIY this today

Here's a minimal, realistic DIY plan you can execute without hiring anyone:

1. Set up Google Search Console and wait until you have at least 30 days of data.
2. Export the Queries report and your sitemap.xml.
3. Paste both into your AI tool with prompts like the ones above.
4. Pick 3-5 high-impact pages the model recommends (service pages, FAQs, location pages).
5. Use AI to draft, then spend real time editing and making them genuinely useful.
6. Publish them over 3-4 weeks, not all at once.
7. Re-check Search Console monthly and keep iterating.

You will learn a ton just by doing that.

## When to bring in a partner

If you're a founder already juggling hiring, sales, product, and operations, you probably don't have the bandwidth to deep-dive GSC exports, architect sitemaps, hand-hold AI models, and ship technically clean pages every week.

That's literally what we do at Prism. We plug into your existing site (or rebuild it if needed), set up and clean up your analytics stack, build the AI-powered SEO flywheel on top, and run it continuously so your online presence compounds over time instead of stagnating.

If that sounds useful, start with our [AI SEO services](/ai-seo-services) and reach out. If you're more in DIY mode, use this post and the video as your playbook.

Either way: this is the best time to build. Put your site out there, connect it to the right tools, and start letting AI help you design and execute a smarter content strategy. You're not too small to outrank large, slow incumbents; you're just one good flywheel away.
