## intro

if your dental, wellness, or medical campaign suddenly shows “health in personalized advertising,” don’t panic. the label is not a suspension or disapproval — it just signals that google applies stricter rules when your ad touches anything health-related. keep calm, learn the guardrails, and you will stay compliant without losing spend.

## 1. what the policy means

google prohibits personalized targeting around health conditions, treatments, or services. that includes dentists, med spas, chiropractors, fertility clinics, mental health professionals, and similar verticals. you can advertise the service, but you cannot tailor delivery based on a user’s health, medical history, or inferred condition.

in short: the ad runs, but google strips away certain audience targeting options so nobody feels singled out.

## 2. why you are seeing “eligible (limited)”

the most common status reads:

> “eligible (limited) — health in personalized advertising”

this means:

- ✅ your ad is approved and can serve.
- ⚠️ it will skip audiences where the policy restricts targeting.
- ❌ you do not need to submit an appeal.

think of it as an informational warning, not a penalty.

## 3. when this affects you

expect the label when any of these are true:

- your site clearly markets healthcare, dentistry, wellness, or medical services.
- you run performance max or smart campaigns, which bundle multiple placements and audience signals.
- you advertise in regions with tighter privacy laws (united states, canada, united kingdom, european union, australia, etc.).

## 4. how to stay compliant

**do this:**

- keep messaging factual and service-focused (appointment availability, locations, credentials).
- describe benefits without implying the viewer has a condition (“professional whitening available” is better than “do you have stained teeth?”).
- review remarketing audiences and custom segments — remove any built on health behaviors or sensitive intent.

**avoid this:**

- targeting users by medical condition, age bracket, or inferred health interest.
- using copy that suggests the viewer has a specific issue you can fix.
- layering sensitive keywords into audience signals (leave them to search intent instead).

## 5. can you appeal it?

since the ad is still eligible, appeals are rarely necessary. only pursue an appeal if google fully disapproves the ad (very rare). when that happens:

1. click **appeal** next to the policy notice in google ads.
2. choose **disagree with decision**.
3. submit context showing your copy is compliant.

google will manually review the ad creative.

## 6. quick example

**allowed:**

> “family dental care in santa rosa. book your next cleaning today.”

**not allowed:**

> “fix your tooth pain fast. personalized dental solutions for you.”

the second example implies knowledge of a personal condition and hints at tailored treatment — that crosses the policy line.

## conclusion

seeing “health in personalized advertising” means google is simply cautious with health targeting. your ads are still running, but the platform trims any personalization that could feel invasive. stay transparent, avoid personal health claims, and you will keep delivering leads without policy headaches.
