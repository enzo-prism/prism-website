# Claude Code to Figma
## Why This Changes How We Build at Prism

Today feels like a turning point.

Figma just announced **Claude Code to Figma via MCP**. You can now generate work in Claude Code, type "Send this to Figma," and the browser rendered state translates into fully editable Figma layers.

That sounds simple.

It is not.

It is architectural.

## From Linear Workflow to Fluid Creation

For years, product development followed a predictable path.

> Idea to Design to Code to Ship

Then AI arrived.

Suddenly we could:

> Prompt to Generate to Iterate to Deploy

The speed was intoxicating. I have been living inside **Claude Code and Codex** for months, building systems, shipping experiments, and deploying apps in days instead of weeks. The acceleration is real.

But something subtle happened.

I drifted away from Figma.

Not because it was not powerful. Not because I stopped valuing design. The center of gravity shifted to the terminal. When you can generate UI instantly, you start designing in code by default.

The problem:

Momentum can become tunnel vision.

The first version becomes the version.

## Figma Was Always About Taste

I have been using Figma since college.

Back when it felt revolutionary just to collaborate in real time. Back when Auto Layout felt like magic. Figma shaped how I think about product.

At its core, Figma is not about pixels. It is about perspective.

A canvas lets you:

1. Compare multiple directions side by side
2. Zoom out and see systems
3. Refine micro interactions through direct manipulation
4. Develop taste

AI expands possibility. Taste filters possibility.

In a world where models can generate nearly anything, the differentiator is no longer production capacity.

It is discernment.

## The Real Shift: Intelligence to Agency to Craft

The last two years were about intelligence.

Bigger models. Better reasoning. Faster inference.

Now we are entering the **agency era**. Tools that act, execute, and build.

**Claude Code and Codex** gave us execution speed. We can scaffold products instantly, wire up APIs, and deploy infrastructure.

This new Figma bridge adds something critical:

**Reflection.**

Instead of:

> Prompt to Ship

We get:

> Prompt to Generate to Send to Canvas to Explore to Refine to Pull Back to Code to Ship

That loop is powerful.

It reintroduces deliberate design into high speed building.

## What This Means for Prism

At Prism, we build growth systems, AI tools, and high performance websites for ambitious teams.

Speed matters.

Quality matters too.

Over the past year, our iteration speed exploded. AI made it possible to test ideas quickly, deploy microsites, generate marketing flows, and spin up product experiments.

This integration changes the workflow again.

Here is how we will use it.

### Divergent Exploration Before Convergence

Instead of locking into the first generated layout, we will send early concepts to Figma and intentionally explore variations.

Not one landing page direction.

Five.

Side by side.

Then we choose.

### Design as Strategic Filter

When possibilities are infinite, clarity matters more.

The canvas becomes where we:

1. Evaluate hierarchy
2. Refine typography
3. Stress test visual systems
4. Pressure test brand consistency

### Code and Design as a Two Way Street

Previously, handoff felt directional.

Now it is cyclical.

Generate in Claude.
Refine in Figma.
Push changes back into code.

That loop compounds quality.

## A Personal Note

I love Claude Code. I love Codex. I genuinely believe they are the most powerful creative tools we have ever had.

I also love design.

Over the past six to twelve months, I felt myself drifting away from the design canvas because velocity was so addictive.

This feels like the moment that pulls everything together.

The terminal gives us leverage.

The canvas gives us judgment.

Together, they give us acceleration without sacrificing craft.

## The Bigger Picture

We are entering an era where:

1. Anyone can build
2. Fewer people can curate
3. Taste compounds
4. Systems thinking wins

The best builders will not be the ones who generate the most.

They will be the ones who navigate possibility space with precision.

That is why this matters.

Figma is not trying to compete with AI. It is positioning itself as the convergence layer: the place where ideas, prompts, sketches, terminals, and prototypes come together.

## What Happens Next

At Prism, we are doubling down on:

1. Faster iteration cycles
2. Higher design standards
3. AI assisted production with human led curation
4. Systems that scale both speed and taste

Building is accelerating.

Quality still matters.

The world we live in is unbelievable.

This integration feels like one of those subtle but important inflection points that, in hindsight, we will realize changed how software was made.

We are just getting started.
