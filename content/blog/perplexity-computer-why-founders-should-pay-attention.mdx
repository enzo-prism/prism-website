Something significant just happened in AI, and most founders are going to scroll right past it.

On February 25, 2026, Perplexity (the company that started as an AI-powered answer engine) launched **Perplexity Computer**. It's not another chatbot. It's not another search wrapper. It's what the company is calling "a general-purpose digital worker."

And if you're building a business right now, this matters more than you think.

## What Perplexity Computer actually is

Here's the short version: Perplexity Computer is an AI system that can take a high-level objective and execute it end-to-end. Research, planning, design, coding, deployment, monitoring. The full lifecycle.

The longer version is where it gets interesting.

Computer doesn't rely on a single AI model. It orchestrates **19 different frontier models** in parallel, routing each subtask to the model best suited for the job. The core reasoning engine is Claude Opus 4.6. Image generation runs through Nano Banana. Video goes to Veo 3.1. Lightweight tasks get handled by Grok. Long-context queries and web search go to GPT-5.2.

Think of it like a CEO delegating across a team of specialists, except the team works 24/7, doesn't need coffee, and can spin up new team members on demand.

You describe the outcome you want, and Computer decomposes it into a task graph. It sequences the work, manages dependencies, runs tasks in parallel where possible, and delivers the result. If something fails, it spawns additional agents to troubleshoot.

And the whole thing runs in an isolated sandbox, so security issues don't bleed into your primary systems.

## Why this is different from ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini

If you've been using ChatGPT or Claude for your business, you already know how useful a good AI conversation can be. But there's a ceiling.

With traditional chatbots, **you are the orchestrator**. You prompt, you evaluate, you copy-paste, you decide what's next, you switch between tools. The AI is reactive. It answers questions. It generates text. But it doesn't *do* things across systems.

Perplexity Computer flips that model.

Instead of you managing a conversation loop, Computer manages a **workflow**. It connects to over 400 integrations (Slack, Gmail, Google Calendar, Notion, CRMs) and can take actions across them. It has persistent memory, meaning it remembers your past work and context. And it can run in the background for weeks or months, only surfacing when it actually needs your input.

The shift is from **conversation to orchestration**. From AI as a tool to AI as a teammate.

## What this means for founders (practically)

Let's cut through the hype and talk about what this actually looks like for someone building a business.

### Competitive research on autopilot

Tell Computer to monitor your top 5 competitors. It will track their pricing changes, new feature launches, content strategy, and social media presence. Get a monthly PDF report with analysis and recommendations. It will run that process indefinitely, using web search agents, browser automation, and document generation in coordination.

### Content pipelines that run themselves

Describe a content strategy. Say, "analyze our top-performing blog posts, identify 20 new topic opportunities based on search trends, draft outlines for the top 10, and write the first 3." Computer can research trending keywords, analyze your existing content, generate SEO-optimized drafts, and deliver them in whatever format you need.

### Prototype to production faster

If you have a product idea, you can describe it in natural language and watch Computer research the market, design the architecture, write the code, and deploy a working prototype. The Reddit community is already sharing examples of Computer building and deploying functional web apps in under 15 minutes, with 50 concurrent agents working in parallel.

### Client reporting at scale

For agency owners and service businesses: imagine describing a reporting workflow once and having it execute across all your clients. Pull analytics data, generate branded reports, email them on schedule. Every month. Without touching it again.

### Financial and operational analysis

Point Computer at your data and ask it to identify trends, anomalies, and opportunities. It can pull from connected tools, run analysis in a sandboxed coding environment, generate visualizations, and deliver the insights as a polished document.

## The "safer agent" angle

If you've been following the AI agent space, you've probably heard of OpenClaw, the always-on autonomous agent that went viral this month. It's powerful, but it also made headlines when a Meta AI researcher had to physically run to her computer to stop it from deleting her entire inbox.

Perplexity is explicitly positioning Computer as the **safer alternative**. Every task runs in an isolated sandbox. The system enforces scoped permissions and can pause for human approval before executing irreversible actions like publishing content or sending emails. You stay in control of the high-stakes decisions.

For founders who want agent-level automation without the stomach-dropping risk of something going wrong at 2 AM, this distinction matters.

---

## The pricing model

Perplexity Computer is currently available to **Max subscribers** ($20/month for Pro, higher tier for Max). Max users get 10,000 credits per month, and at launch, Perplexity is offering a one-time bonus of 20,000 extra credits that expire after 30 days.

The credit system is usage-based, so you can choose which models power specific subtasks and set spending caps. This means you can optimize for cost or quality depending on the task. Need heavy reasoning? Route to Opus. Quick text generation? Use something lighter.

Pro and Enterprise access is coming soon.

## What to watch for

Computer is brand new. It launched today. The architecture is sound (multi-model orchestration with sandboxed execution and human checkpoints) but real-world proof will come from actual usage over weeks and months.

Here's what I'd watch:

- **Task success rates**: How often does it complete complex, multi-step workflows without getting stuck?
- **Quality over time**: Do long-running projects maintain consistency, or does context degradation become an issue?
- **Integration depth**: How well do the 400+ connectors actually work for specific business tools?
- **Credit economics**: Is 10,000 credits/month enough for meaningful work, or will most founders need more?

---

## The bottom line

We've been talking about AI agents for two years. Most of what shipped was incremental: better chat, better search, better code completion.

Perplexity Computer is the first product I've seen that genuinely attempts to be **the AI employee**. Not a tool you use. A system that does the work.

For founders, the question isn't whether AI agents will change how businesses operate. That's already happening. The question is whether *this* implementation (multi-model orchestration, sandboxed execution, persistent memory, 400+ integrations) is the right architecture for real business workflows.

Based on what I'm seeing on launch day, the answer is cautiously optimistic.

The founders who will win in 2026 are the ones who learn to delegate, not just to people, but to systems. Perplexity Computer is making that possible at a scale we haven't seen before.

If you're building something, go try it. Describe your most tedious recurring workflow and see what happens.
