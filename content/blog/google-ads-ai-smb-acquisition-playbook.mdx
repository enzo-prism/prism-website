  <em>Launch a lean, testable paid engine in days—not months—and use AI to do the heavy lifting.</em>
  </p>

If you’ve built something great but struggle to get customers, this playbook shows a simple, repeatable way to validate demand, launch ads, measure results, and scale—without wasting budget. It’s designed for local service businesses and B2B SMBs (dentists, clinics, home services, fitness, SaaS tools, etc.).

---

## Why this works

1. **Start with intent**: Win buyers already searching for you on Google.
2. **Keep pages simple**: One page, one offer, one call‑to‑action.
3. **Measure from day one**: Track clicks → sign‑ups → paying customers.
4. **Let AI speed the grunt work**: Research, write, and produce creative faster.

---

## Step 1: Validate demand in 30 minutes

* **Find real searches**: Use a keyword tool (e.g., Keywords Everywhere) to confirm people are looking for your offer. Don’t fear "small" volume—niche keywords can be highly profitable.
* **Scan forums**: Search Reddit/Quora for pain points and keyword language customers actually use.
* **Decide your first offer**: Define one high‑value outcome (e.g., *Book a whitening consult*, *Get a free quote*, *Start 7‑day trial*).

**Deliverable:** A short list of 5–10 exact phrases people search that match your offer.

---

## Step 2: Spin up a lean landing page (1 hour)

**Rules of thumb**

* No top navigation; reduce exits.
* Above the fold: clear headline that mirrors your keyword, a short benefit subhead, proof, and a primary CTA.
* Secondary trust signals: badges, concise FAQs, 1–3 testimonials.

**Example layout**

* **H1:** *Emergency Dentist in Palo Alto – Seen Today*
* **Subhead:** *Same‑day pain relief. Transparent pricing. Insurance friendly.*
* **CTA:** *Call now* or *Book a 15‑min triage call*
* **Proof:** “4.9★ from 327 patients” + logos/insurers
* **Tiny FAQ:** Hours, insurance, financing, parking

You can build this in Webflow, Framer, Lovable, or even a simple HTML block. For fast validation, embed a Tally or Typeform as the CTA.

**Deliverable:** One landing page per keyword theme.

---

## Step 3: Launch a Google Search campaign that *actually* learns

1. **Campaign objective:** Start with **Website traffic (Clicks)**. This collects real search terms and lowers the data you need to optimize early.
2. **Location targeting:** Countries/regions where you operate. Use *Presence* (people in your location), not *Presence or interest*.
3. **Match types:** Add your terms as **Phrase match** first ("emergency dentist palo alto"). Layer **Exact match** later for your winners. Use **Negative keywords** to block irrelevant clicks (e.g., "jobs," "school").
4. **Ad groups:** Group tightly by intent (e.g., *Emergency*, *Implants*, *Whitening*). 3–5 ads each.
5. **Ad copy:** Mirror the keyword in your Headline 1 and your landing page H1. Promise the outcome; show 1–2 proof points; one CTA.
6. **Budget:** Start small (e.g., $25–$50/day). Aim for 10–20 clicks/term/week to learn.

**Deliverable:** One search campaign with 2–4 tightly themed ad groups and matching pages.

---

## Step 4: Track what matters with Google Tag Manager (GTM)

Set up events so Google & Meta can optimize to real outcomes.

* Install **GTM** site‑wide (head + body).
* Define events:

  * `page_view` (auto)
  * `lead_submit` (form submit or *Book now* click)
  * `call_click` (tap‑to‑call on mobile)
  * `purchase` or `payment_success` (for SaaS/e‑commerce)
* Push events to the data layer on the action (e.g., form success), trigger a tag in GTM, and connect that conversion to Google Ads & Meta Ads.
* Start by optimizing to a **higher‑funnel event** (e.g., *lead submit*) until you have enough volume (15–30+ per week), then switch to deeper events (e.g., *payment_success*).

**Deliverable:** Verified conversions in Google Ads & Meta Ads managers.

---

## Step 5: Layer in Meta (Facebook/Instagram) with AI‑assisted creative

Search captures demand; social creates it. On Meta, great **creative** wins.

**Make 10–20 short videos quickly with AI**

* Use Perplexity/ChatGPT to extract pain points & write 10 hook variations.
* Use HeyGen (avatar) + ElevenLabs (voice) to produce UGC‑style explainer videos fast. Edit in CapCut/Descript (tight pacing, captions, on‑screen headline).
* Try Instagram’s **Trial Reels** to test reach organically, then promote winners.

**High‑performing script template (40–60 seconds)**

1. **Hook (5s):** Call out the audience + pain ("If you’re scared of implant costs…")
2. **Problem (10s):** Agitate with specifics customers say online.
3. **Vision (10s):** Paint the desired future.
4. **Bridge (10–20s):** Your offer is the path (what, for whom, proof).
5. **CTA (5s):** One clear action.

**Deliverable:** 8–12 video variations live; cut losers, double‑down on winners.

---

## Step 6: Do the math (so you know what you can pay to grow)

* **ARPU** (Average revenue per user): e.g., $150 per new patient visit
* **LTV** (Lifetime value): e.g., $1,200 over 12–24 months
* **Target CAC** (what you can afford to acquire a customer): typically **≤ 20–30% of LTV**. With $1,200 LTV, you can pay **$240–$360** CAC profitably.
* Translate CAC to **CPL** (cost per lead) using your close rate. If you close 25% of leads, your target CPL is ~$60–$90.

Now you have guardrails for bids/budgets and when to scale.

---

## Step 7: Weekly optimization rhythm (60–90 minutes)

**Monday**

* Scan search terms → add negatives → add 1–2 new exact/phrase keywords
* Duplicate best ad, test a new hook/benefit

**Wednesday**

* Review conversions by campaign/ad → pause 0‑click ads or expensive losers
* Refresh 2 creatives on Meta (new hook or proof element)

**Friday**

* Confirm call recordings/form quality
* Move budget from losers → winners
* Ship one new landing page tailored to an emerging keyword

---

## Step 8: Sample quick‑start bundles you can copy

**For a dental practice**

* Keywords: "emergency dentist near me", "same‑day crown Palo Alto", "dental implants Palo Alto"
* Page themes: Emergency | Implants | Veneers | Whitening
* Offers: *Same‑day emergency slot*, *Free 10‑min consult*, *$99 New‑Patient Special*
* Proof: Before/after photos, Google rating, insurer logos

**For a B2B SaaS**

* Keywords: Problem‑specific long‑tails (e.g., "YouTube channel email extractor")
* Page themes: Each core job‑to‑be‑done as its own page
* Offers: *Free 7‑day trial*, *Request demo*, *Use on 100 rows free*
* Proof: ROI math, case study tiles, logos

---

## 7‑Day Launch Plan

**Day 1:** Validate 10 keywords; draft one‑page offer & page copy.

**Day 2:** Build the landing page; embed form/booking; add trust.

**Day 3:** Set up Google Ads (Clicks). Phrase‑match 10 terms. Location = Presence.

**Day 4:** Install GTM; wire up `lead_submit` conversion to Google & Meta.

**Day 5:** Produce 8 short videos with AI; publish 4 as Trial Reels.

**Day 6:** Launch Meta Conversion campaign with 4 best creatives.

**Day 7:** Review search terms & conversions; add negatives; iterate.

---

## Common pitfalls to avoid

* **Mixed messages:** Keyword, ad headline, and page H1 must match.
* **Too many options:** One page = one action.
* **No conversions set up:** If platforms can’t see your goals, they can’t optimize.
* **Creative fatigue:** Refresh weekly; retire losers; remix winners.
